## What is cks-mcp?

`cks-mcp` is an MCP server: it lets an LLM client (Claude Desktop, or any
other MCP-speaking client) validate, evolve, branch, merge, and search a
**Canonical Knowledge Structure** through 24 tools, instead of holding
that knowledge loosely in its own context. See [the overview](index.md)
for why that matters.

## Installation

```bash
pip install cks-mcp
```

This pulls in `cks-runtime` (which in turn depends on `cks-core`) as a
dependency — you don't need to install those separately unless you're
developing against them directly.

Requires **Python 3.12+**.

## Optional environment variables

| Variable | Used by | Purpose |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `CKS_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` | `search_semantic` | `"fastembed"` (default) for local, token‑free embeddings; `"huggingface"` for the HuggingFace Inference API. |
| `HF_TOKEN` | `search_semantic` | Required only when `CKS_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=huggingface`. |
| `CKS_LLM_PROVIDER` | `construct_knowledge` | `"auto"` (default — prefers a local Ollama server, falls back to Anthropic), `"ollama"`, or `"anthropic"`. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | `construct_knowledge` | Required only for the `"anthropic"` provider. |
| `CKS_LLM_MODEL` | `construct_knowledge` | Overrides the Anthropic model (default `claude-sonnet-4-6`). |
| `CKS_OLLAMA_MODEL` | `construct_knowledge` | Overrides the Ollama model (default `llama3.2`). |
| `CKS_OLLAMA_HOST` | `construct_knowledge` | Ollama server URL (default `http://localhost:11434`). |
| `CKS_LLM_MAX_TOKENS` | `construct_knowledge` | Overrides max-tokens (default `4096`). |
| `CKS_MCP_DATA_DIR` | server startup | Overrides `~/.cks-mcp` (DB + provenance secret). |
| `CKS_MCP_SECRET` | provenance signing | Overrides the auto‑generated HMAC secret. |
| `CKS_GOSSIP_ENABLED` | gossip sync | `"false"` (default). Set `"true"` to sync Sessions with other `cks-mcp` instances — see [Gossip](#gossip-syncing-sessions-across-multiple-cks-mcp-instances-optional) below. |
| `CKS_GOSSIP_HOST` | gossip sync | Interface to listen on (default `127.0.0.1`). |
| `CKS_GOSSIP_PORT` | gossip sync | Port to listen on (default `8765`). |
| `CKS_GOSSIP_PEERS` | gossip sync | Comma-separated peer addresses, e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:8765,http://192.168.1.11:8765`. |
| `CKS_GOSSIP_INTERVAL_S` | gossip sync | Seconds between gossip rounds (default `5.0`). |
| `CKS_GOSSIP_DISCOVERY` | gossip sync | `"false"` (default). Set `"true"` to auto-discover peers-of-peers beyond the static `CKS_GOSSIP_PEERS` list. |
| `CKS_GOSSIP_SELF_ADDRESS` | gossip sync | This instance's own externally-reachable address, advertised to peers when discovery is on. |
| `CKS_GOSSIP_SECRET` | gossip sync | Overrides the auto‑generated HMAC secret peers use to authenticate gossip envelopes to each other. Must be identical on every peer. |

Instead of exporting these in your shell, you can drop them into
`~/.cks-mcp/.env` (one `KEY=value` per line) — the server reads that file
on startup if it exists. This is convenient for `HF_TOKEN` and
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in particular, since Claude Desktop launches the server
without your shell's environment.

## Connect to Claude Desktop

1. Install all three packages into a single virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv cks-env
   source cks-env/bin/activate
   pip install cks-core cks-runtime cks-mcp
   ```

2. Open Claude Desktop → **Settings → Developer → Edit Config**, and add:

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "cks-mcp": {
         "command": "/absolute/path/to/cks-env/bin/cks-mcp"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Save and fully restart Claude Desktop (quit, then reopen). A connector
   icon for `cks-mcp` (24 tools) should appear.

Any other MCP client that speaks JSON-RPC over stdio works the same way —
point it at the `cks-mcp` executable.

## Your First Session

A typical workflow is: create something, inspect it, change it, and look
at its history. Here's the shortest version, as raw `tools/call` requests
(what your MCP client sends under the hood when you type a plain-English
request):

**1. Validate a structure — this also creates your session:**

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "validate_knowledge",
    "arguments": {
      "json_data": "{\"objects\":[{\"identity\":{\"id\":\"obj-1\",\"type\":\"Definition\",\"name\":\"Photosynthesis\"},\"structure\":{}}]}"
    }
  }
}
```

The response includes a `session_id` — keep it, every following call uses it.

**2. Change it:**

```json
{
  "method": "tools/call",
  "params": {
    "name": "evolve_knowledge",
    "arguments": {
      "session_id": "<session_id from step 1>",
      "operations": [
        {"type": "add_object", "identity": {"id": "obj-2", "type": "Definition", "name": "Chlorophyll"}, "structure": {}},
        {"type": "add_relation", "identity": {"id": "rel-1", "type": "Relation", "name": "r"}, "participants": ["obj-1", "obj-2"], "relation_type": "requires"}
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

**3. See what changed:**

```json
{"method": "tools/call", "params": {"name": "list_versions", "arguments": {"session_id": "<session_id>"}}}
```

From here, `query_subgraph` or `visualize_graph` let you look at the
structure itself; `search_semantic` lets you find things in it by meaning
once it grows past what you can hold in your head. The full set of 24
tools, grouped by what they're for, is in the
[Tools Reference](tools/index.md).

**In practice**, you don't write raw `tools/call` JSON yourself — in Claude
Desktop, just start a message with **"Use cks-mcp to…"** and the model
picks the right tool and arguments for you.

**To use semantic search without any API keys** — which is now the
default — leave `CKS_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` unset (`fastembed`) and the
server will download a small (~90 MB) sentence‑transformers model
once on first use, then run fully offline from that point on.

**To use `construct_knowledge` without any API keys**, run
[Ollama](https://ollama.com) on `localhost` — `construct_knowledge`
auto‑detects it and uses a local `llama3.2` model by default, no
`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` needed.

## Gossip: syncing Sessions across multiple cks-mcp instances (optional)

By default, each `cks-mcp` instance is fully local: Sessions live only in
its own database. If you run `cks-mcp` in more than one place — e.g. one
Claude Desktop on your laptop and another on a desktop machine, or one
per teammate — you can turn on gossip so Sessions sync between them
automatically, without exporting/importing by hand. See
[ADR-005](adr/ADR-005%20Gossip%20Integration.md) for the design
rationale.

**It's off by default**, and binds to `127.0.0.1` unless you explicitly
tell it otherwise — turning it on changes this from a purely local
process to one that listens on (and dials out over) the network.

Two-machine example — machine A at `192.168.1.10`, machine B at
`192.168.1.11`, both reachable on the same network:

```bash
# ~/.cks-mcp/.env on machine A
CKS_GOSSIP_ENABLED=true
CKS_GOSSIP_HOST=0.0.0.0
CKS_GOSSIP_PORT=8765
CKS_GOSSIP_PEERS=http://192.168.1.11:8765
CKS_GOSSIP_SECRET=base64:<32 random bytes, same value on every peer>
```

```bash
# ~/.cks-mcp/.env on machine B
CKS_GOSSIP_ENABLED=true
CKS_GOSSIP_HOST=0.0.0.0
CKS_GOSSIP_PORT=8765
CKS_GOSSIP_PEERS=http://192.168.1.10:8765
CKS_GOSSIP_SECRET=base64:<the same 32 random bytes as machine A>
```

Generate a shared secret once with:

```bash
python -c "import os, base64; print('base64:' + base64.b64encode(os.urandom(32)).decode())"
```

Restart `cks-mcp` (or restart Claude Desktop) on both machines. Sessions
created on either one will show up on the other within
`CKS_GOSSIP_INTERVAL_S` seconds (default 5) of the next gossip round —
no export, no manual sync tool call.

**Same-machine, two local instances** (e.g. testing, or two separate
Claude Desktop profiles): use `CKS_GOSSIP_HOST=127.0.0.1`, distinct
`CKS_GOSSIP_PORT` values, and `CKS_MCP_DATA_DIR` pointed at two separate
directories so they don't share one SQLite database.

If a peer is unreachable, gossip rounds against it back off
automatically and retry later — it never blocks tool calls, which run
against the local database regardless of gossip's state.

## Running the Test Suite

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Deus-corp/cks-mcp.git
cd cks-mcp
pip install -e ".[dev]"
python -m pytest -v
```
