# Security Model

`cks-mcp` sits at the boundary between an LLM and the rest of the CKS
ecosystem. Its trust model follows from one premise: **the LLM and its
input are untrusted**. The server enforces every safety and integrity rule
itself, regardless of whether the LLM correctly requests it, remembers to
ask, or is actively trying to produce convincing-looking fabricated data.

This covers two independent concerns: preventing the server from being
used as an SSRF vector, and preventing fabricated verification claims from
ever being treated as genuine.

## SSRF & DNS-Rebinding Protection

`verify_source`, `ingest_document`, and `check_component_versions` are the
tools that make an outbound HTTP request directly on the server's behalf,
and the Enrichment Agent's source adapters (`enrichment/adapters.py`,
`enrichment/robots.py`) do the same when fetching from Wikipedia/arXiv. All
of them route through the same `_safe_request` implementation — the
protection isn't duplicated per-caller, and a new tool or adapter that
needs to fetch a URL gets the same guarantees by construction.

The request goes through three checks, in order:

1. **Scheme allow-list.** Only `http` and `https` are accepted.
2. **Public-IP validation.** The hostname is resolved, and *every* IP it
   resolves to must be a public address — private, loopback, link-local,
   multicast, reserved, and unspecified ranges are all blocked. Two ranges
   Python's `ipaddress` module doesn't classify as private but that aren't
   public internet either are also explicitly blocked: `100.64.0.0/10`
   (RFC 6598 Shared Address Space — the range Tailscale and several cloud
   providers use for internal node addressing) and `192.0.0.0/24` (IETF
   protocol assignments). If a hostname resolves to *any* non-public
   address alongside public ones, the whole request is refused — not just
   the unsafe address.
3. **DNS-pinned connection.** The actual request is pinned to the specific
   IP validated in step 2, via a reference-counted, thread-local override
   of `socket.getaddrinfo`. This closes the gap between "the address we
   checked" and "the address we connect to" — without it, a DNS response
   could legitimately differ between the validation lookup and the
   request itself (classic DNS rebinding). The override preserves SNI and
   TLS certificate validation, unlike mutating the connection pool
   directly.

**Redirects are followed manually, one hop at a time**, up to a fixed
limit — never via `requests`' built-in `allow_redirects=True`. Every new
`Location` is re-resolved and re-validated through the same three checks
before it's followed. Without this, a server that passed the initial
check could redirect straight past it to an internal or cloud-metadata
endpoint.

## Provenance Enforcement

A `VerificationRecord` is supposed to mean "this claim was actually
checked." The problem: a `VerificationRecord` that was *never* checked —
just hand-crafted by an LLM to look convincing — is structurally
indistinguishable from a genuine one. Static validation alone cannot tell
them apart (see [`verification_record`](extensions.md#verification_record)
for why that's a hard limit, not an oversight). Closing that gap needs two
things working together:

1. **A single sanctioned constructor.** `verify_source` is the *only* tool
   that builds a `VerificationRecord` — always from the result of a real
   HTTP request it just performed itself, never from caller-supplied
   fields.
2. **A signature only that constructor can produce.** Every record
   `verify_source` builds is signed with an HMAC-SHA256 over its content
   (`record_id`, `subject_id`, `checked_at`, `checked_via`, `http_status`),
   keyed by a secret held only by the running server process
   (`CKS_MCP_SECRET`, persisted to `~/.cks-mcp/.cks_provenance_secret` on
   first use so a restart doesn't invalidate history).

Everywhere else a structure can enter or leave the system —
`validate_knowledge`, `evolve_knowledge`, `merge_knowledge`,
`merge_branch`, and the `json_data` fallback paths of
`serialize_knowledge`/`explain_knowledge`/`detect_contradictions` — checks
every `VerificationRecord` in it against that signature, **unconditionally**,
whether or not the caller asked for the `verification_record` extension.
A record without a valid signature produces a `CKS-MCP-UNVERIFIED-PROVENANCE`
diagnostic and is treated as unverified.

Two extra edge cases the check closes:

- **Structural identification, not label-based.** A relation is recognized
  by having `participants` + `relation_type` in its structure — the same
  way `cks-core` itself identifies one — never by trusting
  `identity.type == "Relation"`. A forged record linked via a `verified_by`
  relation carrying some other `identity.type` would otherwise slip past
  as "unlinked" (a warning) instead of hitting the signature check (an
  error).
- **Ambiguous references are rejected outright.** If more than one subject
  claims the same `VerificationRecord` via `verified_by`, that's flagged
  as `CKS-MCP-AMBIGUOUS-VERIFICATION-REFERENCE` before the signature is
  even checked — an ambiguous claim isn't something a signature check can
  resolve.

**Nothing invalid is ever committed, even partially.** For a fresh
`json_data` structure with a forged record, `validate_knowledge` doesn't
even register the session via `runtime.create_session()` — it dry-runs
against a throwaway, unregistered `RuntimeSession` first. If it registered
the session before the provenance check, the forged record would already
be live and readable through `serialize_knowledge`, `query_subgraph`, or an
MCP Resource on that `session_id`, regardless of what the validation
response itself said. The same dry-run-before-commit shape is used by
`evolve_knowledge`, `merge_branch`, and `merge_knowledge` for the same
reason: a version is exactly what every downstream reader will treat as
trustworthy, so nothing becomes a version unless it's already known-good.

## Optional HTTP Transport

When `CKS_MCP_HTTP_PORT` is set, `server.py` starts an `aiohttp` server
alongside the default stdio transport, with CORS enabled for local
development (e.g. `cks-studio` running in a browser). By default this
transport carries no authentication of its own beyond whatever the
network it's bound to already provides, so it should not be exposed on
an untrusted network without enabling the token auth described below.
All the SSRF and provenance guarantees above apply identically
regardless of which transport a request arrived through.

Alongside `POST /mcp` (JSON-RPC), the HTTP transport also exposes
`GET /events` (and `GET /events/{session_id}`), a Server-Sent Events
(SSE) stream of runtime lifecycle events — `SessionCreated`,
`VersionCreated`, `TransactionCommitted`, `GossipConflictDetected`,
`CRDTForkDetected`, and others — so a thin client like `cks-studio` can
react to changes made by other users or agents without polling. See
`src/cks_mcp/transport/sse.py` (the EventBus-to-subscriber broadcaster) and
`src/cks_mcp/transport/http_events.py` (the aiohttp route). Same trust boundary as
`/mcp`.

### Token authentication

Setting `CKS_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` turns on bearer-token auth for both
`/mcp` and `/events*`, enforced by an `aiohttp` middleware
(`_auth_middleware` in `server.py`, backed by `src/cks_mcp/transport/http_auth.py`)
that runs before any route handler and rejects unauthenticated
requests with `401` before the JSON-RPC dispatcher or SSE stream ever
starts. The token can be supplied two ways:

- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — for `fetch`/JSON-RPC clients hitting
  `/mcp`.
- `?token=<token>` query parameter — for browser `EventSource` clients
  consuming `/events`, since `EventSource` cannot set custom request
  headers.

Token comparison uses `hmac.compare_digest` to avoid leaking the
token's value through response-timing differences. If
`CKS_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` is unset (the default), auth is disabled and
behavior is unchanged from before this option existed. This setting
only affects the HTTP transport; the stdio transport has no concept of
requests to authenticate.

## Trust Boundary Summary

| Layer | Responsibility |
|-------|-----------------|
| `cks-mcp` | Enforces provenance and SSRF protection at the MCP boundary — the only layer that knows an `VerificationRecord` needs a signature, or that a URL came from an untrusted LLM. |
| `cks-runtime` | Session/transaction integrity, storage safety — doesn't know or care what a `VerificationRecord` is. |
| `cks-core` | Structural and semantic validation — checks a `VerificationRecord`'s *shape*, never its provenance (it never sees the signing key). |

See [`SECURITY.md`](../SECURITY.md) for how to report a vulnerability, and
[Extension Model](extensions.md) for the full opt-in constraint set this
document's provenance section is one (unconditionally-enforced) part of.
