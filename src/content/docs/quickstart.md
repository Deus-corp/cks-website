# Quick Start

Get CKS up and running with your LLM in under 5 minutes.

---

## 1. Install

One command installs the entire ecosystem:

```bash
pip install cks-mcp
```

This automatically brings in `cks-runtime`, `cks-core`, and all dependencies.

---

## 2. Connect to Claude Desktop

Add `cks-mcp` to your MCP servers.

1. Open Claude Desktop → **Settings** → **Developer** → **Edit Config**.
2. Add this block to `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "cks-mcp": {
      "command": "cks-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

   If `cks-mcp` was installed into a virtual environment rather than your
   global Python, use the absolute path to its executable instead (e.g.
   `/path/to/venv/bin/cks-mcp`) — Claude Desktop launches the command
   directly and won't have your shell's activated environment.

3. Save and restart Claude Desktop (Cmd+Q, then reopen).

After restart, a connector icon will appear — **cks-mcp** with 24 tools is
ready to use.

---

## 3. Your First Experiment

Ask Claude:

> Create a knowledge structure about "Quantum Mechanics" with two concepts (Wave-Particle Duality and Superposition). Link them with a relation. Then validate the structure.

Claude will call `validate_knowledge` and report back whether the structure is valid.

## What's Next

- Browse the [Tools Reference](cks-mcp/tools/index.md) — all 24 tools,
  grouped by what they're for, with request/response examples.
- Explore the [cks-core](cks-core/index.md) semantic engine.
- Learn about [cks-runtime](cks-runtime/index.md) sessions and version history.
- Read the [Architecture](cks-mcp/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md) and
  [Security Model](cks-mcp/security.md) of the MCP server.
