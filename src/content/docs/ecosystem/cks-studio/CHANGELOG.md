# Changelog

All notable changes to CKS Studio will be documented in this file.

The format is based on Keep a Changelog and this project follows Semantic Versioning.

---

## [0.21.4] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- **Regression tests for Explore Neighbourhood** – added `GraphPage.exploreNeighbours.test.tsx` covering repeated explore clicks preserving the selected node, accumulating neighbours without data loss, and the empty-neighbour case not clearing the graph.

### Notes
- No production code changes; test coverage only.

---

## [0.21.3] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- **Google Gemini provider status** – Settings now correctly displays `Google Gemini` when the backend reports `provider: "google"` and `google_configured: true`. Includes the model name and availability dot.
- **Preferred provider dropdown** – added `Google Gemini` to the local LLM provider preference selector.
- **Auto-scroll for chat panels** – new `useAutoScrollToLatest` hook keeps the latest turn (or the “thinking…” placeholder while a reply is in flight) in view for both full Chat and Quick AI. Auto-scroll pauses when the user scrolls up and resumes when they return near the bottom.

### Fixed
- **Google API key setup snippet** – added a copyable `CKS_GOOGLE_API_KEY` example to Settings.
- **Demo version test** – updated the hardcoded component version expectation from `v1.22.0` to `v1.23.0` to match the current bundled `cks-ecosystem.json`.

### Tests
- Added regression tests for:
  - auto-scroll behavior in ChatPanel and QuickAiPanel (new message + thinking indicator)
  - `useAutoScrollToLatest` hook (scroll on new items, pause when scrolled away, resume near bottom)
  - Google provider status display in Settings

---

## [0.21.2] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- **Theme first-visit default** – first visit now defaults to `auto` instead of forcing `dark`. The stored mode is persisted as `auto`, so the OS preference is resolved until the user explicitly picks a different mode.
- **Theme OS-listener wiring** – `ensureAutoThemeListener()` is now called on module load, so OS theme changes are reflected automatically instead of waiting for a Settings visit.

### Changed
- **Shared Focus icon** – extracted a single `GraphFocusIcon` component and used it in both `GraphCanvas` (2D) and `GraphCanvas3D`, removing the mismatched inline SVG icons.
- **Settings Model field** – `Preferred model` replaced by a simpler `Model` input; value still stored in `settingsStore.selectedModel` and sent to `ai_chat` as the optional `model` override when provided.

### Tests
- Added `themeStore.test.ts` covering first-visit default `auto`, persistence of explicit modes, OS-preference resolution, and idempotent listener wiring.
- Updated `SettingsPage.test.tsx` for the renamed `Model` field.

---

## [0.21.1] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- **Theme stability** – mounting Settings no longer changes the active theme. Theme preference now has an explicit `mode` (`dark` | `light` | `auto`) and `auto` is only resolved when selected, not as a side effect of visiting Settings.
- **Chat retry duplication** – Retry now resends the existing transcript in place instead of appending a duplicate user turn. Retry is only shown on the trailing user turn.
- **Version Diff dropdown** – long version list now uses a custom fixed-position listbox with internal scroll, preventing options from drifting upward/out of view.
- **3D Focus alignment** – Focus button now top-aligns with the zoom controls block instead of being vertically centered.
- **React Flow attribution** – removed the bottom-right React Flow watermark from the 2D canvas and added a “Built with” attribution in Settings → About.

### Changed
- `useAiChat.retry()` no longer requires an existing error state; it can retry the trailing user turn as long as the last turn is still the user.
- Theme store and Settings/Demo Settings updated to use `ThemeMode` for explicit `auto` support.

### Tests
- Added regression tests for no-theme-change-on-settings-mount, retry without duplication, and version dropdown scrollability.

---

## [0.21.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added
- **Belief revision actions** – “Why this belief?” is now actionable:
  - Active inference steps are ranked by confidence with a “Most supported” badge.
  - When multiple steps conclude the same object, a “Resolve conflict” section lets the user pick a winner and call `arbitrate_inference_conflict` with `commit: true`.
  - Steps flagged with stale premises show a warning and a “Repair stale premise” action calling `arbitrate_inference_conflict` with `stale_premise_ids`.
- **`useArbitrateInferenceConflict` hook** – handles resolve/repair mutations, error states, and graph refresh via `graphVersion`.
- **Stale premise detection** – `useExplainInference` now peeks `list_inference_conflicts` to collect `CKS-EXT-STALE-PREMISE` findings for active steps without draining the queue.

### Changed
- `mcpTools` adds typed wrappers `arbitrateInferenceConflict` and `listInferenceConflicts`.
- `shared/types/graph.ts` adds types for arbitration responses, stale-premise resolutions, and inference-conflict records.

### Tests
- Added coverage for ranking, conflict resolution, stale premise repair, and error/empty states.

---

## [0.20.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- **Preferred model in Settings** – AI & LLM now has a local “Preferred model” field (persisted in `settingsStore`) intended to be sent to `ai_chat` as a per-call model override, e.g. `nvidia/nemotron-3-super-120b-a12b:free`.
- **Complete OpenAI-compatible server setup snippets** – separate copyable env-var snippets for `CKS_LLM_PROVIDER`, `CKS_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `CKS_OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `CKS_OPENAI_MODEL`, replacing the previous incorrect `CKS_LLM_BASE_URL` example.
- **Security note** – Settings now explains that API keys must be set on the server, not in the browser.

### Changed
- Preferred model input placeholder and width updated for long provider/model prefixes.
- OpenAI-compatible setup block now explicitly lists all four required variables.

### Known note
- Full wiring of the preferred model into actual chat sends may require a follow-up patch if `useAiChat` does not yet read `settingsStore.selectedModel`.

---

## [0.19.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- **Inference detection via `structure.conclusion`** – SidePanel now finds InferenceStep objects that conclude the selected node using the `conclusion` field, so manually authored steps show in the Inference section and `Why this belief?`.
- **SidePanel height** – GraphPage and SidePanel now use `min-h-0` and proper flex constraints so long panel content scrolls instead of stretching the page.
- **3D controls** – 3D graph now uses the same zoom/fit/fullscreen controls block as 2D instead of a standalone fullscreen button.
- **Control shadow consistency** – 2D/3D controls block now uses the standard `shadow-lg` treatment, matching other toolbar buttons.
- **Sidebar button shadows** – Start Pipeline, Publish to Gallery, and Clear Highlight now have consistent shadows.
- **Clear Highlight / Reset graph alignment** – the row now vertically centers the two actions.

### Added
- Tests for `conclusion` inference detection, GraphPage layout constraints, 3D controls, and button shadows.

---

## [0.19.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- **Sectioned node SidePanel** – node details are now grouped into collapsible sections: Overview, Pipeline / Transitions, Agent Findings / Research, Inference, and Provenance / Verification. Overview always remains visible, so basic object info (id, type, name, structure) is no longer hidden by agent statuses.
- **CollapsibleSection component** – reusable accessible section toggle with chevron, used by the new SidePanel.
- **SidePanel utilities** – `findReasoningNodesFor`, `findInferenceStepsFor`, and `findProvenanceFor` for discovering related agent findings, inference steps, and verification records from the graph.

### Changed
- SidePanel now handles `ReasoningNode` findings and `InferenceStep` chains separately from transitions, with sections hidden when empty.
- Fork nodes still use the dedicated ForkDiffPanel.

### Tests
- Added SidePanel tests for overview visibility, pipeline sections, agent findings, empty inference, hidden provenance, and collapsible toggling.

---

## [0.18.3] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- **Per-message actions in chat** – each chat bubble (full Chat and Quick AI) now has Copy, Retry (user turns only), and Share actions. Share uses the Web Share API when available and falls back to copying the text.
- **Explore neighbourhood viewport keeper** – after exploring a node, the selected node is automatically brought back into view if the layout moves it outside the current viewport.

### Fixed
- **Duplicate edge IDs** – `cksToReactFlow` now derives edge IDs from content (`source->target:relation_type`) instead of a per-call index, preventing React key collisions and silently dropped edges when multiple edges between the same nodes differ by relation type.
- **Explore neighbourhood no longer appears to drop the selected node** – the node remains in the store and viewport fix makes it visible immediately.

---

## [0.18.2] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- **Why this belief? now sees freshly added InferenceSteps** – after a Chat/Quick AI turn mutates the graph via `evolve_knowledge`, the graph version is bumped so an already-open “Why this belief?” panel re-fetches and shows the new inference chain instead of stale “No inference chain found”.
- **Version Diff crash** – `explainDiff` now normalizes missing `details` fields to empty arrays, and `countDiffChanges` defensively handles partial response shapes, preventing the full-page `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'added_objects')` error.
- **Diff page stale response race** – VersionDiff now ignores out-of-order responses when switching target versions/sessions quickly.

### Added
- `graphVersion` counter in graphExplorerStore, bumped after full refetches and committed `evolve_knowledge` mutations.
- Tests covering chat-integrated inference refresh and missing-details diff shapes.

---

## [0.18.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- **Dead Letter crash** – `DeadLetterPanel` and `listDeadLetteredConflicts` now safely normalize missing or `null` `tasks` to an empty array. Switching tabs after an error no longer leaves the ErrorBoundary fallback stuck.
- **Quick AI Clear chat confirmation** – clearing quick chat history now asks for confirmation, matching the full Chat panel.
- **Gallery card action alignment** – `Check health` / `Open in Graph` row is now pinned to the bottom of each card, so buttons don’t shift vertically based on description/tags.
- **AI chat truncation handling** – when `ai_chat` reaches its tool-call iteration limit, the studio now detects the truncated state and shows a Continue button instead of leaving the turn looking like a normal finished reply.

### Added
- **Continue truncated chat** – `useAiChat` now exposes `continueTruncated()`, and both ChatPanel and QuickAiPanel render a Continue action for truncated assistant turns.
- **Structured `truncated` flag** – `AiChatResult` now includes `truncated?: boolean`, with fallback detection by reply text for older backends.
- **Tests** for dead-letter empty states, quick chat confirmation, truncated chat behavior, and MCP wrapper normalization.

### Changed
- `mcpTools.listDeadLetteredConflicts` now returns normalized shape `{ tasks, count, supported }`.

---

## [0.18.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- **Persistent chat per session** – chat history is now stored per `session_id` and survives tab switches and reloads. Added a “Clear chat” button to both Quick AI and full Chat.
- **Create graph creates a session** – the logo menu’s Create graph action now immediately creates a new empty session via `validate_knowledge`, so AI Chat is instantly available without loading a graph from the gallery.
- **Dead Letter session filter** – the Dead Letter Inbox now offers a “Current session only” toggle, filtering tasks by the active session id.
- **Liveness cleanup UI** – AgentPanel hides stale stopped agent processes and surfaces placeholder cards for known agent kinds, while old liveness rows are pruned server-side.

### Fixed
- **Graph flicker / session race** – switching tabs or sessions no longer causes nodes to temporarily disappear due to stale async responses.
- **Why this belief? after object creation** – newly created nodes/relations are now automatically selected, so the inference panel can be opened immediately instead of appearing to do nothing.
- **Start Pipeline message/state** – success messages no longer linger indefinitely and Stop behavior is cleaner.
- **Publish input focus** – typing in the gallery publish dialog no longer selects all text on every keystroke.

---

## [0.17.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- **Logo dropdown menu** – clicking the CKS logo opens a file-style menu with Create graph, Save graph, Load graph, Export graph, and Import graph. Export/Import work with canonical CKS JSON, not PNG/SVG.
- **Delete graph from Gallery** – each gallery card now has a trash icon with confirmation, backed by the new `unregister_graph` MCP tool.
- **Retry button in chat** – failed chat messages in both Quick AI and full Chat now show a Retry action for retriable errors (network/llm_call_failed/other). `useAiChat` now separates send and attempt logic so retrying does not duplicate messages.
- **Theme-aware user chat bubbles** – user messages now use `--color-chat-user-bg` (`#1c263d` dark, `#f7f9ff` light) instead of the old blue accent.

### Changed
- `PublishToGalleryButton` can be opened programmatically via a new `publishDialogStore`.
- `graphExport` now has a JSON blob download helper for canonical CKS export.
- `mcpTools` adds `getFullGraphAsJson`, `importGraphFromJson`, and `unregisterGraph` wrappers.

### Tests
- Added tests for logo menu actions, import/export, delete gallery flow, chat retry, and session switching.

---

## [0.16.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed
- **Quick AI / Chat session switch** – when `ai_chat` calls `validate_knowledge` or `construct_knowledge` without a `session_id`, the studio now detects the newly created session, switches the connected session, and reloads the graph accordingly.
- **OpenAI-compatible LLM status** – `get_llm_status` now recognises `openai_compatible` as a valid provider. Settings no longer shows “Not configured” when using an OpenAI-compatible endpoint; provider label and model display correctly.

### Added
- Tests for session switching from Quick AI and for OpenAI-compatible status display.

---

## [0.16.0] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed
- **Light-theme forms** – New object and New relation forms no longer use hardcoded dark colors; they now follow theme tokens (`bg-surface-*`, `border-border*`, `text-text-*`, `text-danger`, `text-warning`).
- **Start Pipeline UX** – success message now auto-dismisses after 5 seconds and clears on selection changes. Stop button is hidden when no pipeline process has ever reported a heartbeat.
- **Publish input focus** – fixed a bug where typing in the graph name field selected the whole text on every keystroke. The publish modal now preserves input focus.
- **Large graph preview** – gallery preview now shows a “Large graph — open it to explore” message with an Open graph button when the graph exceeds a readable size.

### Added
- **Known standalone agents** – AgentPanel now shows all known standalone agent kinds (Critic, Enrichment, Fork Resolution, Pipeline) even before they first send a heartbeat, with a “not running / no heartbeat yet” placeholder card.

### Changed
- Standalone Processes section no longer shows a generic empty message; missing known agents are represented individually.
- `GraphPreview` accepts an optional `onOpen` handler for the large-graph fallback.

---

## [0.15.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- **Graph Lifecycle UI** – gallery cards now show a color-coded lifecycle badge (`draft`, `published`, `active`, `stale`, `under_review`, `archived`).
- **Lifecycle transition dropdown** – clicking the badge opens a menu offering only the allowed next states; selecting one calls `update_graph_lifecycle`, reloads the gallery, and shows inline errors on failure.
- **MCP wrapper `updateGraphLifecycle`** – typed client for the new backend tool, returning discriminated success/noop/error shapes instead of throwing.

### Changed
- `GraphRegistryEntry` now includes `lifecycle_state` and a `LifecycleState` union type.
- `GraphGallery` renders lifecycle badges and handles team/public badges more consistently.

### Tests
- Added wrapper tests and UI tests for lifecycle badge, transition flow, terminal `archived`, and inline error display.

---

## [0.14.1] - 2026-08-15

### Changed
- **Start Pipeline button** – more compact layout with a play icon, separate count badge, and icon-only Stop button. Full label is preserved and tooltips are provided.
- **Publish to Gallery button** – now includes a book icon and matches the compact side-panel button style.
- **Clear Highlight button** – added an X icon and consistent border/background treatment.
- **Type legend** – removed duplicate type icons, uses a smaller indicator dot, and truncates long type names cleanly.
- **Minor visual consistency** – side-panel action buttons now share the same compact `surface-3` + subtle border style.

---

## [0.14.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **IconButton component** – reusable icon-only button with accessible label and native tooltip.
- **Icon toolbar in GraphPage** – New object, New relation, Cross-Graph Link, Explore Neighbourhood, Trace Inference, and Reset Graph are now compact icon buttons with tooltips.
- **Icon toolbar in ExportControls** – Refresh, PNG export, and SVG export now use icon buttons with accessible labels and spinners for loading states.
- **Icon focus/fullscreen in 2D/3D graph** – Focus mode and fullscreen toggles now use icon buttons; active focus state remains visually distinct.
- **Icon actions in QuickAiPanel and WhyThisBeliefPanel** – Open full Chat and close controls are icon-only with tooltips.
- **Icon actions in GraphGallery cards** – Preview and Clone actions are now icon buttons with tooltips.

### Changed
- Existing text-only buttons replaced by icon buttons across the most visible surfaces.
- All icon-only buttons have `aria-label`; `title` is used as a native tooltip.
- Tests added for `IconButton`.

### Known note
- Some existing tests may need to query by accessible name (`aria-label`) instead of visible text; update if needed.

---

## [0.13.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **Accessibility: modal focus management** – new `useModalA11y` hook shared by dialogs (CompareGraphsModal, PublishToGallery) to trap focus, handle Escape, move focus into the dialog on open, and restore focus on close.
- **Accessibility: keyboard navigation on 2D graph** – arrow keys move focus between nodes based on spatial layout, Enter/Space selects the focused node, Ctrl/Cmd+Enter toggles multi-select, and focus ring is now visible on nodes.
- **Accessibility: 3D keyboard zoom** – the 3D canvas is focusable with an accessible label and supports plus/minus for zooming.
- **Accessibility: labelled dialogs** – PublishToGallery and CompareGraphsModal now use proper dialog semantics with `aria-labelledby`.
- **Performance: route-level code-splitting** – all non-Graph pages are now `React.lazy` loaded, reducing the main entry chunk.
- **Performance: lazy html-to-image** – PNG/SVG export utilities now dynamically import `html-to-image` only when an export is triggered.
- **Performance: memoisation** – `GraphCard` and `MiniTurnBubble` are memoized; `RunHistoryPanel` uses `useMemo` for derived lists; `GraphGallery` uses a stable `useCallback` for compare selection.

### Changed
- `App.tsx` now lazy-loads Pipeline, Gallery, Diff, Settings, Agents, Dead Letter, and Chat pages.
- `GraphCanvas` keyboard handling and focus styles updated.
- `CrossGraphLinkForm` supports Escape-to-cancel and is labelled with `aria-labelledby`.

### Tests
- Added tests for keyboard navigation, modal a11y, focus trap/restore, and lazy route rendering.

---

## [0.12.0] - 2026-08-15

### Changed
- **Run History uses real `list_pipeline_runs`** – replaced the deterministic mock loader with a real MCP call. `RunHistoryPanel` now displays actual ADR-007 pipeline runs, including per-step status, timestamps, errors, and dead-letter task ids.
- **MCP wrapper `listPipelineRuns`** – added adapter in `mcpTools.ts` that maps the backend’s snake_case response to the UI’s camelCase `PipelineRun` shape.
- **Mock removed** – `mockRuns.ts` now delegates to `listPipelineRuns(sessionId)` and `IS_MOCK_DATA = false`; no demo banner is shown when real data is available.
- **Tests updated** – RunHistoryPanel tests now mock `listPipelineRuns` and assert that no mock badge is displayed.

### Known limitation
- The backend `list_pipeline_runs` only reconstructs runs started after `run_id` tracking was introduced; older runs without `run_id` won’t appear.

---

## [0.11.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **Cross-graph Compare UI** – Gallery now has a Compare mode with per-card selection (capped at 2). Selecting two graphs and clicking “Compare selected” opens a modal showing shared object count, unique-to-each-side lists, and field-level differences.
- **Cross-graph Merge UI** – from the Compare modal, users can merge the two graphs into a new session, optionally register the result under a name, and resolve conflicts by keeping all from either side. The merged session can be opened directly.
- **Cross-graph Link form** – on GraphPage, with an object selected, a new “Cross-Graph Link” action opens a form to pick a target registered graph, target object, relation type, and optional name. Calls `link_graphs` and writes the link to both graphs.
- **MCP client wrappers** – `compareGraphs`, `mergeGraphs`, `linkGraphs` in `mcpTools.ts` with snake_case parameter mapping and structured error handling.
- **Types** – `CompareGraphsResult`, `MergeGraphsResult`, `LinkGraphsResult`, `CompareGraphsDifference`, `MergeGraphsConflict`.
- **Tests** – extensive coverage for wrappers, gallery compare mode, compare modal, merge conflict flow, and cross-graph link form.

### Changed
- `GraphGallery` now supports compare mode with selection checkboxes and a floating Compare selected bar.
- `GraphPage` SidePanel includes the Cross-Graph Link action.

---

## [0.10.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **Pipeline Run History** – new `RunHistoryPanel` on the Pipeline page listing recent ADR-007 pipeline runs with status, step-level details (Researcher → Synthesizer → Reviewer → Arbiter), timestamps, errors, and dead-letter task references. Backed by a deterministic mock dataset until a `list_pipeline_runs` MCP tool exists; swapping the mock loader for a real MCP call is a one-line change.
- **Pipeline run utilities & types** – new status enums, sorting, filtering, truncation, and step-completion helpers.
- **Tests** – added coverage for run list rendering, expand/collapse, empty/error states, and utilities.

### Known limitation
- Run history currently uses mock data; backend integration is pending a future `list_pipeline_runs` tool.

---

## [0.9.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **Publish to Gallery** – new `PublishToGalleryButton` modal on the Graph page side panel. Users can publish the current session as a registered graph with name, description, tags, and visibility (`private`, `team`, or `public`).
- **Mermaid graph preview** – gallery cards now have a lazy “Show preview” toggle that renders the graph as an inline SVG using Mermaid. The library is dynamically imported, so it doesn’t bloat the main bundle.
- **Team-scoped visibility** – gallery now supports `visibility` and `team` fields from the backend registry. A new team filter input narrows the gallery to a specific team namespace.
- **Graph type/source lineage display** – `GraphRegistryEntry` includes `source_graph_name` for clone lineage (already partially delivered earlier; now fully integrated with cards/badges).

### Changed
- `mcpTools` client wrappers updated for `visibility`, `team`, and `visualize_graph`.
- `galleryStore` now manages team filter and updated load/search logic.
- `GraphGallery` UI now displays visibility/team information and previews.
- Main bundle size reduced by code-splitting Mermaid into a separate async chunk.

### Known issue
- Tests for the new Publish button, Mermaid preview, and team filters are not yet included; they will follow in a separate patch.

---

## [0.8.1] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **Forked from lineage in Gallery** – cloned graphs now show a “Forked from <source>” badge and can jump back to the original graph. The badge is clickable and triggers a gallery search for the source name.
- **`source_graph_name` in GraphRegistryEntry** – studio type now includes clone lineage info from the backend.
- **Tests** for lineage badge rendering and source-jump behavior.

### Changed
- `GraphGallery` now uses `source_graph_name` from registered graphs.

---

## [0.8.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **Persistent gallery storage** – the local dev MCP launcher now uses `~/.cks-mcp/cks_mcp.db` instead of `/tmp/cks-studio-dev.db`, so registered graphs survive reboots and remain in the gallery until explicitly deleted.
- **Clone graph from Gallery** – each public graph card now has a Clone button that calls the new `clone_graph` MCP tool, sets the returned session as current, and navigates to the Graph page. Inline success/error messages are shown.
- **Gallery tag filters** – clickable tag chips built from the union of tags across visible graphs, allowing quick filtering by tag.
- **Gallery sorting** – sort dropdown with Most recently updated, Name A-Z, and Name Z-A (client-side).
- **CloneGraph wrapper** – added `cloneGraph()` to `mcpTools` with snake_case argument mapping and structured error handling.

### Changed
- `GraphGallery` and `galleryStore` now manage sort order and tag filter.
- Added utility functions `collectTags` and `sortGraphs`.
- Added tests for clone flow, gallery filters, sorting, and utility functions.

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- **Settings 2.0** – expanded Settings page with tabbed sections: Appearance, Connection, AI & LLM, Graph Behavior, About, and Danger Zone.
- **`settingsStore`** – new Zustand store persisting all client-side settings to localStorage, with defaults and `resetAllSettings()`.
- **Graph defaults** – default view mode (2D/3D), default layout direction (TB/LR), minimap/legend/edge label toggles.
- **Connection settings** – MCP server URL, recent sessions list, live SSE toggle, refresh debounce and polling interval controls.
- **AI preferences** – preferred provider/model inputs, Quick AI default open toggle, and server setup snippets for Ollama/Anthropic/OpenAI-compatible/HTTP server.
- **Graph behavior settings** – focus mode defaults for 2D/3D, degree-based sizing toggle, polling interval.
- **Danger Zone** – reset all settings with confirmation, returning theme and preferences to defaults.
- **Tests** – added store persistence, settings page, integration, and reset tests.

### Changed
- `GraphCanvas` and `GraphCanvas3D` now initialize focus mode from settings defaults.
- `GraphPage` now respects `showTypeLegend`, SSE debounce/auto-reconnect settings.
- `AgentPanel`/`DeadLetterPanel` polling interval now driven by settings.
- `QuickAiPanel` default open state driven by settings.

---

## [0.6.32] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **Bottom overlay alignment** – TypeLegend and bottom dock panels now use a shared `15px` offset, aligning them with React Flow’s built-in MiniMap/Controls margin. In 3D mode, the dock is raised slightly (`21px`) to avoid 3d-force-graph’s nav hint.
- **WhyThisBeliefPanel label** – collapsed tab now says “Select a node” when no node is selected (already partially delivered; now consistent).

---

## [0.6.31] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **Graph page panel positioning** – “Why this belief?” collapsed tab now shows “Select a node” when no node is selected. The tab is raised above 3d-force-graph’s built-in navigation hint in 3D mode. Quick AI launcher is positioned to avoid overlapping the React Flow MiniMap in 2D and the bottom-right corner in 3D.
- **Panel overlap prevention** – bottom dock panels now account for view mode and existing bottom-right UI elements.

---

## [0.6.30] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- **Why this belief? panel** – collapsible bottom panel on Graph page for inspecting the active inference chain of the selected node. Uses `explain_knowledge(object_id=...)` and shows operator, confidence, justification, premises chips, and superseded steps.
- **Quick AI panel** – collapsible mini-chat on Graph page that reuses the same conversation store as the full Chat page. Supports quick questions, tool-call responses, error display, and an “Open full Chat” button that navigates to `/chat` with the shared conversation intact.
- **`useExplainInference` hook** – fetches inference explanation with request-sequence guard and proper loading/error states.
- **Tests** for both panels and the new hook/type integration.

### Changed
- Graph page bottom dock now hosts independent collapsible panels (`WhyThisBeliefPanel` centered, `QuickAiPanel` bottom-right) that don’t block the canvas elsewhere.

---

## [0.6.29] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- **Demo Pipeline page** – static Kanban-style pipeline monitor derived deterministically from the bundled ecosystem graph. Shows four stage columns (`Awaiting Research`, `Awaiting Review`, `Needs Research`, `Resolved`) with mock cards and transition logs. No backend required.
- **Demo Diff page** – static version diff example showing one added, one removed, and one modified object with color-coded rows and count badges. Includes a mock modified `cks-core` version change (`v1.21.1` → `v1.22.0`) and a fictional `cks-analytics` addition.
- **`listDemoGraphObjects`** – exported helper from `mockClient` that returns non-relation objects from the bundled graph for demo pages.
- **Tests** for both new demo pages.

### Changed
- The static demo banner and README/demo comments now reflect that all tabs have mock content instead of placeholders.

---

## [0.6.28] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- **Metrics strip** – new reusable `MetricsStrip` component placed on Agents and Pipeline pages. Shows key operational metrics: registered graphs, running in-process agents, alive standalone processes, and dead-letter task count. Updates every 10 seconds, pauses when the tab is hidden, and handles per-metric errors gracefully.
- **`useMetricsStripPolling` hook** – polls `list_graphs`, `list_agents`, `list_processes`, `list_dead_lettered_conflicts` independently using `Promise.allSettled`, so a failure in one source does not blank the rest.

### Changed
- Agents and Pipeline pages now render `MetricsStrip` above their existing content.
- Added unit tests for metrics strip rendering, error placeholders, unsupported backend handling, polling, and visibility pause.

---

## [0.6.27] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- **Graph stats in Node Types panel** – the bottom-left legend now has a Stats/Types toggle. Stats view shows graph name/session id, node count, edge count, visible type count, selected count (if any), and most connected node.
- **Consistent toolbar shadows** – refresh, PNG export, and SVG export buttons now have the same shadow treatment as the zoom/fullscreen controls.

### Changed
- **2D zoom controls theme** – React Flow zoom/fullscreen controls now match the background, border, and blur of the other toolbar buttons.
- Added tests for TypeLegend stats toggle.

---

## [0.6.26] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- **Real-time session event subscription** – GraphPage now subscribes to the cks-mcp `/events` SSE endpoint and automatically refreshes the graph when `VersionCreated`, `TransactionCommitted`, `GossipConflictDetected`, `CRDTForkDetected`, or `AgentStepCompleted` events arrive. Updates are debounced/coalesced, so bursts of events trigger one refresh.
- **`sessionEvents` / `useSessionEvents`** – framework-agnostic SSE wrapper and React hook for the real-time connection. No-op in demo mode, with automatic reconnect and backoff.
- **Tests** – unit tests for SSE connection logic, filtering, debouncing, session change, and unmount behavior.

### Changed
- ROADMAP updated: Real MCP Session Presence marked in progress.

---

## [0.6.25] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **2D focus button centering** – Focus toggle now correctly accounts for react-flow’s built-in 15px panel margin when computing its `top`, so the gap above and below Focus is truly equal. Previously the rendered gap above was larger than the gap below, making Focus appear biased toward the zoom controls.
- **Focus centering regression tests** – added a concrete arithmetic test that verifies the true rendered gaps above and below Focus are identical.

---

## [0.6.24] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **Demo graph persistence** – GraphPage in the static demo now remains mounted when switching demo tabs, matching the real studio behavior. The 3D graph no longer re-unfurls, resets the camera, or loses selected node state when navigating away and back.
- **2D focus button centering** – the Focus toggle is now dynamically positioned exactly between the Export SVG row and the zoom/fullscreen controls using measured heights and a shared gap, instead of a hand-tuned pixel offset that could go stale.

### Added
- Regression tests for the 2D focus centering formula.

---

## [0.6.23] - 2026-08-14

### Fixed
- **Graph state persistence across navigation** – GraphPage is now kept mounted when navigating to other tabs, so 3D camera, force-simulation positions, focus mode, and selected node no longer reset when returning to the Graph tab.
- **Removed repeated 3D reinitialization** – avoiding unmount/remount of GraphCanvas3D eliminates costly WebGL context rebuilds and simulation restarts on every tab switch.

### Added
- Regression test `App.persistentGraphPage.test.tsx` asserting GraphPage is hidden rather than unmounted when on another route.

---

## [0.6.22] - 2026-08-14

### Changed
- **3D card theme refresh batching** – card texture updates now process in small batches per animation frame instead of one synchronous pass, preventing main-thread stalls on large graphs during theme toggles.
- **3D card texture filtering** – card textures no longer generate mipmaps, reducing GPU overhead and improving theme-switch responsiveness.
- **Light-theme 3D cards** – cards now use a warm amber fill with white text and a darker amber border, greatly improving contrast against the light canvas.

### Added
- Regression tests covering light-theme card colors, disabled mipmaps, and batched refresh logic.

---

## [0.6.21] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- **3D theme refresh effect** – the debounced theme-repaint effect now correctly depends on `theme`. It previously ran only once on mount, so later light/dark toggles did not repaint 3D cards and links. Added a regression test asserting the dependency array is `[theme]`.

---

## [0.6.20] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- **3D theme refresh dependency** – the theme-refresh effect now correctly depends on `theme`, so 3D cards and links repaint immediately when the theme toggles. Previously the effect only ran on mount, so theme changes had no effect on the 3D graph.
- **3D link/border theme colors** – 3D links and card borders now use theme-aware colors, matching the light/dark palette and improving visibility.
- **Debounced theme repaint** – rapid theme toggles no longer stack full-graph texture redraws; the repaint is debounced.

### Added
- **Regression tests** for theme-aware link colors and the dependency fix.

---

## [0.6.19] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- **2D toolbar overlap** – repositioned the Focus toggle, zoom/fullscreen controls, and Export SVG buttons so they no longer overlap. The top-right controls now have explicit, non-colliding offsets.
- **3D light-theme cards** – card background now uses the 2D surface-3 token (`#e5e7ec`) instead of pure white, improving contrast and readability against the light canvas.
- **GPU resource leak** – added `disposeNodeObject3D` and call it before `nodeThreeObject` rebuilds in focus mode, exit focus, and relation-draft updates. This prevents leaking textures and materials on every rebuild, which was the real cause of progressive lag in long 3D sessions.

### Added
- **Regression tests** for GPU disposal (`disposeNodeObject3D`) and theme colors.

---

## [0.6.18] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- **3D theme switching performance** – theme toggling now refreshes existing card textures in place instead of rebuilding all node sprites and materials, preventing GPU memory leaks and progressive lag after repeated light/dark switches.
- **3D card light theme** – cards now use a near-opaque light-theme background and readable text, matching 2D node styling.
- **2D focus dimming** – nodes outside the focused cluster are now strongly dimmed, while the focused node and its direct neighbors stay fully visible.
- **2D selected node persistence** – selected/focused node keeps the brightened hover appearance after the pointer leaves.

### Added
- **3D card theme tests** – regression test confirming theme colors differ and light theme uses an opaque background.
- **2D focus mode tests** – coverage for dimming behavior and selected-node persistence.

### Changed
- Exported `drawNodeCardCanvas` and `CARD_THEME_COLORS` from `GraphCanvas3D` for testability.

---

## [0.6.17] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- **Auto theme option** – real Settings now offers Light, Dark, and Auto. Auto resolves the current system theme and is visually selected.
- **Stop pipeline button** – Start Pipeline toolbar now includes a Stop Pipeline control that calls `request_process_stop` for the pipeline process.
- **3D focus mode toggle** – 3D focus mode is no longer auto-triggered on node click. A top-right toggle enables focus mode; when off, clicking a node keeps the old select/zoom behavior.
- **2D focus mode** – added a focus mode toggle to the 2D graph. When enabled, clicking a node highlights it and its neighbors while dimming the rest.
- **Additional tests** – added coverage for StartPipelineButton (stop and truncation), ThemeToggle auto behavior, and 2D focus mode.

### Fixed
- **Start Pipeline message overflow** – long run IDs now wrap/truncate inside the message container instead of overflowing.
- **3D performance** – multi-select/focus updates now manipulate existing three.js objects directly instead of rebuilding all node sprites, reducing lag on larger graphs.
- **3D card theme** – cards now adapt to light/dark theme using the same token palette as 2D nodes.

---

## [0.6.16] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- **Start Pipeline button** – select one or more nodes in the 2D/3D graph (Ctrl/Cmd+click for multi-select) and start a pipeline run directly from the graph toolbar. Calls the new `start_pipeline` MCP tool with the current session and selected object IDs.
- **Dead Letter inbox** – new Dead Letter page for reviewing and resolving dead-lettered conflict tasks. Lists tasks via `list_dead_lettered_conflicts`, shows proposed resolutions via `review_dead_letter`, and supports approve/reject actions (`approve_resolution` / `reject_resolution`) with automatic list refresh.
- **Multi-select rings** – selected nodes in both 2D and 3D get a distinct ring indicator, making multi-selection visually clear.

### Changed
- **2D graph controls** – zoom/fullscreen controls positioned so they no longer overlap the Export SVG button.
- **Navigation** – added Dead Letter page to the main nav with its own per-route tint color.

---

## [0.6.15] - 2026-08-13

### Fixed
- **3D focus camera** – entering focus mode no longer zooms the camera out. The cluster is pinned and non-focus nodes are pushed aside, but the camera stays exactly where the user left it. A new “Frame cluster” button in the focus banner lets users frame the focused neighborhood manually.
- **2D controls overlap** – zoom and fullscreen controls moved from bottom-left to top-right in the 2D graph, so they no longer overlap the collapsible Node types legend.

### Added
- **3D fullscreen button** – the 3D graph now has a fullscreen toggle, using the same fullscreen icon and hook as the 2D graph.
- **Shared fullscreen hook** – `useFullscreen` centralizes Fullscreen API handling and `FullscreenIcon` provides a consistent icon for both graph views.

---

## [0.6.14] - 2026-08-13

### Changed
- **3D graph spacing** – default link distance and charge strength adjusted so nodes are roughly twice as far apart, making the 3D graph noticeably less compressed.
- **3D click-to-focus mode** – clicking a node now pins it and its direct neighbors into a stable figure while non-focus nodes are repelled aside and dimmed. The focused cluster is framed automatically; clicking the same node again or the background exits focus mode.
- **Collapsible node type legend** – the legend in the bottom-left can now be collapsed to a compact "Node types" button and expanded again on click.

### Added
- **3D focus ring indicator** – the focused node and its neighbors get a cyan ring (brighter for the primary node, dimmer for neighbors) for clear visual identification.
- **3D axis labels** – X/Y/Z labels added at the axis tips for easier spatial orientation.

---

## [0.6.13] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- **Nightly ecosystem graph auto-update** – new GitHub Actions workflow (`update-ecosystem-graph.yml`) and `scripts/update_versions.py` that run nightly, fetch the latest component versions from PyPI/GitHub, and update `scripts/cks-ecosystem.json` with a minimal diff. Validates the graph with `cks validate` before committing.
- **Automatic demo publishing** – new `publish-demo.yml` workflow builds the static demo from cks-studio and pushes it to `cks-website`'s `public/demo` whenever a `v*` tag is pushed. Other files in `public/` (favicon, og-card, etc.) are preserved.

---

## [0.6.12] - 2026-08-12

### Added
- **Expanded static demo** – Gallery, Agents, Chat, and Settings now have dedicated mock pages in the static demo. Gallery shows illustrative graphs with the bundled cks-ecosystem openable; Agents displays seven in-process sweepers and four standalone processes; Chat presents a sample ai_chat conversation; Settings offers a working theme selector, component versions read from the bundled graph, and a copyable Ollama setup snippet.
- **Demo theme switching** – the demo now respects the active theme store and provides an icon-based light/dark toggle in the nav, in addition to the theme selector on Settings.
- **Demo toast system** – non-functional demo interactions (e.g. opening a gallery card without data) now show a lightweight toast instead of failing silently.

### Changed
- **SettingsPage ThemeToggle exported** – reused by the demo nav and settings pages.
- **mockClient** now exports `listComponentVersions()` and `DEMO_GRAPH_OBJECT_COUNT` from the bundled ecosystem graph for demo pages.

---

## [0.6.11] - 2026-08-12

### Added
- **Per-route nav tints** – top navigation destinations now have distinct hues (Graph, Pipeline, Gallery, Diff, Agents, Chat, Settings) instead of one shared accent, with theme-aware active/hover background washes and underlines.
- **Full studio menu in static demo** – the demo now shows all seven navigation entries. Non-graph sections render a clear “available in full version” placeholder, so the demo communicates the full studio surface without requiring a live server.

### Fixed
- **Chat send button alignment** – the input form now uses vertical centering, keeping the Send button level with the initial textarea height instead of riding low against the bottom.

---

## [0.6.10] - 2026-08-12

### Changed
- **2D node sizing by importance** – `CksNode` and `useGraphLayout` now scale node cards, fonts, and layout dimensions with connection degree (incident edge count), using sqrt-tapered growth to keep the dagre layout stable. Hub nodes (e.g. `cks-core`) render larger than leaf nodes, and each connected node shows a small degree badge.

---

## [0.6.9] - 2026-08-12

### Changed
- **3D card sizing by node importance** – card dimensions in 3D mode now scale with node degree (number of incident edges). Hub nodes (e.g. `cks-core`) render larger than leaf nodes (e.g. `diagnostics`), making structure importance visible at a glance.
- **Degree badge on 3D cards** – each connected card shows a small pill with its connection count in the bottom-right corner (hidden for isolated nodes).

---

## [0.6.8] - 2026-08-12

### Added
- **3D card rendering** – nodes in the 3D graph now render as flat, billboard-style cards matching the 2D node design (type-colored accent strip, icon, name). Hovered cards brighten and show a colored outline; non-neighbor cards dim. Relation-draft participants get numbered badges.

### Changed
- Kept the original sphere rendering behind a `USE_CARD_NODES` toggle for easy fallback.

---

## [0.6.7] - 2026-08-12

### Changed
- **Design sync with cks-website** – dark‑theme palette (surface, border, text) now matches the docs site’s graphite tones.
- **Logo recoloured** from violet to the brand amber (`#e8a33d`) used on the website.
- **Buttons toned down** – primary actions use muted brand amber instead of bright emerald/blue; secondary actions use `surface-3`.
- **Light‑theme brand tokens** added for consistency with the dark theme.

---

## [0.6.6] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- **Demo back-link** – floating "Back to Docs" button returns visitors from the embedded demo to the documentation site.
- **Demo placeholder pages** – Gallery and Pipeline tabs now show a static placeholder instead of an empty page.

### Fixed
- **Empty graph in demo** – `mockClient.querySubgraph` without `seed_ids` now returns the full bundled graph as fallback.

---

## [0.6.5] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- **Static demo** – a standalone `demo.html` that renders the full CKS ecosystem graph entirely in the browser, with no server required. Includes a mock MCP client, restricted navigation (Graph / Gallery / Pipeline), and a demo banner. Built alongside the main studio as a second Vite entry point.
- **`mockClient.ts`** – in‑memory MCP client serving the bundled ecosystem graph for the static demo.

---

## [0.6.4] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- **Missing node type icons** – added colours and icons for `Constraints`, `Event`, `Feature`, `Function`, `LLMProvider`, `Operator`. Unknown types now render a fallback icon (📄) instead of "?".
- **3D sidebar visibility** – the side panel no longer disappears behind the WebGL canvas in 3D mode.

---

## [0.6.3] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- **Chat input** – replaced single‑line `<input>` with auto‑resizing `<textarea>`, added Enter‑to‑send / Shift+Enter‑for‑newline.
- **3D mode side panel** – added `z‑10` to the sidebar so it stays above the WebGL canvas.
- **Missing node type icons** – added colours and icons for `ReasoningNode`, `Entity`, `Axiom`, `Lemma`, `Theorem`, `Proof`, `InferenceStep`, `VerificationRecord`.
- **Agent panel standalone‑process cards** – improved layout, aligned Request Stop buttons, added a note that these processes are started manually.

---

## [0.6.2] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- **3D graph parity** – path highlighting (Shift+click), drag‑and‑drop subgraph import, relation‑draft participant picking, and Cmd/Ctrl+K search now work in 3D mode, matching the 2D GraphCanvas.
- **3D clustering** – nodes are softly grouped by their containing Component/Module, making the ecosystem graph visually separable by repository.
- **3D orientation grid and axes** – a subtle ground plane and RGB axes help orient the view without interfering with the data.
- **2D layout direction toggle** – switch between top‑to‑bottom (TB) and left‑to‑right (LR) dagre layout in 2D mode to handle wide graphs.

### Changed
- **`looksLikeSubgraphResult`** extracted to `graphUtils.ts` and reused by both 2D and 3D canvases.
- **`useGraphLayout`** now accepts a `rankdir` parameter for the layout direction toggle.

---

## [0.6.1] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- **3D graph improvements** – nodes now show always-visible text labels, size scales with degree (hub nodes appear larger), hover highlights the node and its neighbours while dimming the rest.
- **Lazy‑loaded 3D module** – `GraphCanvas3D` is now code‑split (React.lazy + Suspense), so the 2D-only default view never pays the cost of the Three.js bundle.
- **Ecosystem type icons** – added distinct colours and emoji icons for `Component`, `Module`, `ADR`, `Tool`, `Agent`, `Interface`, `StorageBackend`, `Plugin`, `Sweeper`, `Task`, and `Relation` so the ecosystem graph is no longer monochrome.

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- **3D force‑directed graph** – toggle between 2D (dagre) and 3D (force‑graph) views using the new 2D/3D switch in the Graph page header. 3D mode spreads nodes over a volume, making wide graphs with many same‑rank nodes (e.g. many Tools implementing one ADR) much more compact.
- **GraphCanvas3D component** – uses `3d-force-graph` (Three.js) with node colouring by CKS type, click‑to‑focus camera, and hover labels.
- **viewMode** in `graphExplorerStore` – persists 2D/3D preference across page switches.

---

## [0.5.9] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- **SidePanel readability on light theme** – property values now use `text-text-primary` instead of light gray.
- **Search palette centering** – replaced manual `setCenter` with `fitView` for reliable node centering after palette close.
- **Trace Inference visibility** – added drop‑shadow glow and opacity pulse animation so highlighted edges stand out even when crossing other edges.

---

## [0.5.8] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- **Search palette centering** – double `requestAnimationFrame` ensures the target node is measured before centering, preventing off‑screen jumps.
- **Trace inference highlight** – replaced hardcoded `#f59e0b` with a CSS custom property `--trace-highlight`, now green on light theme for better contrast.
- **Light‑theme dark artifacts** – GraphPage header, sidebar, and Gallery search/cards now use theme tokens instead of hardcoded `gray‑*` classes.
- **Light‑theme text contrast** – `--color-text-secondary` and `--color-text-tertiary` darkened for readability.
- **Graph edges and nodes on light theme** – edge stroke and node background are now theme‑aware, improving contrast against the cream background.
- **MiniMap on light theme** – mask color and node colors now adapt to the active theme.
- **Refresh button** – added a ↻ button next to Export controls, reloading the current session graph.
- **Explore Neighbourhood** – fixed logic so it correctly detects newly added nodes instead of silently doing nothing.

---

## [0.5.7] - 2026-08-11

### Fixed
- **Search palette centering** – use a double `requestAnimationFrame` so React Flow finishes measuring the target node after the palette closes, preventing the viewport from jumping off‑screen.
- **Trace inference highlight** – replaced hardcoded `#f59e0b` with a CSS custom property `--trace-highlight`, which now adapts to the current theme (a darker, more saturated tone on light theme).
- **Light‑theme dark artifacts** – replaced the remaining hardcoded `gray‑*` classes in GraphPage, GraphGallery, SidePanel, CreateNodeForm, CreateRelationForm, ForkDiffPanel, ConnectionStatus, and HealthIndicator with design‑token equivalents (`bg-surface‑*`, `text‑text‑*`, `border‑border‑*`).
- **Chat input visual prominence** – the message form now has a distinct background, increased padding, and a leading icon so it no longer blends into the page.

---

## [0.5.6] - 2026-08-10

### Fixed
- **Search palette centering** – deferred `setCenter` to next frame so React Flow can measure the target node, fixing off‑screen jumps to freshly‑added or off‑screen nodes.
- **Node overlap on large graphs** – layout now computes per‑node widths based on label length, preventing long ADR titles from overlapping adjacent nodes.
- **Explore Neighbourhood fallback** – automatically retries at depth=2 when depth=1 returns empty, instead of showing “No neighbours found” for indirectly connected nodes.
- **PNG export quality** – canvas is now sized proportionally to the graph’s bounding box (with a 1600×1200 floor) and uses 3× pixel ratio, keeping text legible on large graphs.
- **Session error recovery** – unreachable sessions are pruned from “Recent sessions” on connection failure, so dead IDs don’t accumulate in the dropdown.
- **Light‑theme cream background** – changed `surface-0` from near‑white to a warm cream tone, improving contrast with white panel surfaces.
- **Agent / Chat / Pipeline / VersionDiff panels** – replaced remaining hardcoded `gray‑*` classes with theme‑aware design tokens.

---

## [0.5.5] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **Model selector in AI Chat** – dropdown next to the Chat title shows available models for the current LLM provider (Ollama via live `/api/tags`, Anthropic and OpenAI‑compatible via hardcoded lists). Selected model is passed as optional `model` argument to `ai_chat`.
- **`listLLMModels`** function in `mcpTools.ts` and **`useLLMModels` hook** – typed wrappers around the new `list_llm_models` MCP tool.
- **`selectedModel`** in `chatStore` – persists the user’s model choice across page switches.
- Unit tests for model selector and `useLLMModels` hook.

---

## [0.5.4] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **AI Chat onboarding** – differentiated error banners for missing session, unavailable LLM provider, network errors, and tool failures. Clear instructions with links to Settings and Graph page.
- **`ChatError` discriminated type** – `no_session` | `llm_provider_unavailable` | `llm_call_failed` | `network` | `other`.
- **Unit tests** for all ChatPanel error states.

---

## [0.5.3] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **PWA support** – the studio can now be installed as a standalone desktop app from Chrome/Edge/Safari. Includes a web manifest, static asset caching via `vite-plugin-pwa`, and theme-color meta tag.

---

## [0.5.2] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **LLM Provider status in Settings** – shows the current LLM provider (Ollama / Anthropic / Not configured), its model, and availability. Includes a Refresh button and setup instructions.
- **ChatPanel LLM status banner** – warns before sending a message if no LLM provider is configured, with a link to Settings.
- **`getLLMStatus`** function in `mcpTools.ts` and **`useLLMStatus` hook** – typed wrappers around the new `get_llm_status` MCP tool.
- **Unit tests** for SettingsPage LLM status display.

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- **Graph skeleton** – shows a pulsing placeholder while a session's graph is loading, instead of an empty canvas.
- **Graph empty state** – invites the user to connect a session or drag in a subgraph export when no graph is loaded.
- **Cmd/Ctrl+K search palette** – fuzzy search over all nodes by label or id with keyboard navigation (arrows + Enter), centres the viewport on the selected node.
- **Type filter in the legend** – clicking a type toggles its visibility on the canvas; a "Show all" button resets the filter. The legend now shows only types actually present in the graph.
- **Light theme** – new `[data-theme="light"]` overrides in `index.css`, a theme store (`themeStore.ts`), and a light/dark toggle on the Settings page. Respects `prefers-color-scheme: light` on first visit.
- **MiniMap node colours** – now reflects the actual CKS type colour.

### Changed
- **English i18n** – remaining Russian strings in `AgentPanel`, `VersionDiff`, and `GraphCanvas` replaced with English.
- **GraphCanvas** accepts an `isLoading` prop; the skeleton renders only while loading and no nodes are on screen.
- **Type legend** is now interactive (checkboxes) instead of static text.
- **Settings page** shows the theme toggle as the first working preference.
- **`hiddenTypes`** added to `graphExplorerStore` to support the type filter.

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- **AI Chat panel** – talk to an LLM directly from the studio; the LLM can call `ai_chat`-scoped tools to read and mutate the graph. Includes collapsible tool-call disclosure and live graph refresh after mutating calls.
- **`useAiChat` hook** and **`chatStore`** – manage conversation state and sync graph after tool calls.
- **New fonts** – self-hosted Manrope (display) and JetBrains Mono (mono) for improved visual hierarchy.
- **Graph node redesign** – subtler top-accent bar instead of full border, refined spacing and typography.
- **Directional arrowheads** on graph edges – filled arrow markers so relation direction reads at a glance.
- **Type legend** visual refresh with icons and semi-transparent glow.
- New unit tests for `toolCallsMutatedGraph`.

### Changed
- Graph canvas hover effect softened (brightness lift instead of box-shadow).
- Edge labels use mono font and background padding for readability.
- Marker color updates dynamically with highlight state.

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- **Agent Control Panel** – Start/Stop in‑process sweepers and Request Stop for standalone agents directly from the Agent Panel, using `start_agent`, `stop_agent`, and `request_process_stop` MCP tools.
- **Dark theme** – design tokens (`surface-0`…`surface-3`, `border`, `text`, `accent`), graph-paper background texture, subtle glow, and scrollbar styling applied globally.
- **Logo mark** – minimal SVG logo in the navigation bar.
- **Keyboard focus indicators** – `:focus-visible` styles for better accessibility.
- **Connection status moved to navbar** – now visible on every page.

### Changed
- Navigation bar redesigned with active state indicators and sticky positioning.
- `GraphPage` header simplified (ConnectionStatus moved to navbar).
- `SettingsPage` placeholder updated to reflect current state.
- `AgentPanel` UI refreshed with consistent design tokens and button interactions.

---

## [0.3.3] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- **Standalone-agent visibility in Agent Panel** – now displays Critic, Enrichment, Fork Resolution, and Pipeline Agent processes from the shared `cks_agent_liveness` table, alongside the existing sweeper cards.
- **`useProcessesPolling` hook** – polls `list_processes` with visibility pause and race-safe request sequencing.
- **`ProcessCard` component** – shows process kind, PID, hostname, heartbeat/started times, status (alive/stopped), and current task.
- **`listProcesses` and `getProcessStatus` functions** in `mcpTools.ts` – typed wrappers.
- **Tests** – 9 UI tests for `AgentPanel`, 6 hook tests for `useProcessesPolling`, and `test/setup.ts` cleanup registration to enable multiple renders per test file.

---

## [0.3.2] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- **Agents page** – displays the status of all in‑process sweepers (contradiction, inference staleness, provenance staleness, temporal staleness, graph freshness, graph auto‑update, graph health) using `list_agents` and `agent_status` MCP tools.
- **AgentPanel component** – shows agent id, running status, interval, last run time (relative), duration, result count, and last error for each sweeper.
- **`useAgentsPolling` hook** – polls agent status at a configurable interval, pauses when the browser tab is hidden.
- **`listAgents` and `getAgentStatus` functions** in `mcpTools.ts` – typed wrappers around the new MCP tools.
- **`formatRelativeTime` utility** – displays timestamps as "3m ago", "2h ago", etc., for agent last run times.

---

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- **Object creation form** – add new nodes directly from the studio with optimistic UI and error feedback.
- **Relation creation form** – select source/target nodes on canvas and define a relation type.
- **Optimistic updates** – new nodes/edges appear immediately (dashed/pending style) and are rolled back on failure.
- **Relation draft mode** – visual picker for selecting relation participants with amber highlight.
- **`useEvolveMutation` hook** – reusable hook for `evolve_knowledge` calls with diagnostics handling.
- **Recent sessions** – stores last 5 connected sessions in `localStorage` for quick switching.

### Changed
- `GraphPage` uses `CreateMode` switch (`none` | `node` | `relation`) instead of a boolean.
- `GraphCanvas` and `CksNode` support relation draft mode and pending states.
- `graphExplorerStore` extended with pending and relation draft state.
- `mcpTools` exports `evolveKnowledge` with proper error discrimination.

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added
- **Version Diff** – compare the current session state with any previous version (via `explain_diff`), with color-coded object/relation changes and summary counters.
- **Export graph to PNG / SVG** – buttons in the top-right corner of the canvas, using `html-to-image`.
- **Type legend** – shows the color mapping for CKS object types (Definition, Claim, Fork, etc.) in the bottom-left corner.
- **Drag-and-drop subgraph JSON files** – drop a `query_subgraph` export directly onto the canvas to load it.
- **Shortest path highlighting** – `Shift+click` two nodes to highlight the path between them (BFS over all edges).
- **Recent sessions** – a dropdown in the header remembers the last 5 connected session/server pairs (stored in `localStorage`).
- **Reset graph** – clears the canvas to start fresh.
- New tests for `findPathBetweenNodes`, `graphExport`, `versionDiffUtils`.

### Changed
- `GraphPage` now auto-connects when a `sessionId` is already present (e.g., from Gallery).
- `traceInferenceChain` now highlights all incoming edges, not just `depends_on`.

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added
- **Graph Gallery** – browse public graphs from `graph_registry` (Memory Agent v1/v2), with search, tag filtering, and lazy health score checks via `check_graph_health`.
- **Pipeline Monitor** – Kanban board showing objects by their `current_status` (Researcher → Reviewer, ADR-007 Milestone 1), with auto-refresh and transition log inspector.
- **Global session store** – `useSessionStore` persists server URL and session ID to `localStorage`, shared across all pages.
- **Navigation bar** – quick switching between Graph, Pipeline, Gallery, and Settings pages.
- **`normalizeCompactSubgraphResponse`** – adapter for `query_subgraph`'s compact mode format, correctly unwrapping nodes/edges from `subgraph` envelope.
- **Session connection status** – idle/connecting/connected/error states reflected in UI.
- **`ErrorBoundary`** – catches render errors in any page and shows a fallback instead of a white screen.
- **`ConnectionStatus` component** – colour-coded indicator for MCP server connectivity.
- **Shared utilities** – `colorUtils.ts`, `formatUtils.ts`, `nodeTypes.ts` to avoid duplication across features.
- New tests for gallery utilities, pipeline utilities, session store, and MCP tools.

### Changed
- **Refactored `CksNode` and `SidePanel`** to use shared constants and utility functions instead of inline colour/icon maps.
- **Removed empty placeholder files** (`GraphControls`, `SemanticEdge`, individual node type files, unused feature folders) to reduce noise.
- **`vitest` setup** now loads `@testing-library/jest-dom` matchers for all tests.
- **`query_subgraph` compact_mode nodes** are now treated as canonical `{identity, structure}` objects (backend no longer sends flat `{id, type, name, props}`).

### Fixed
- **`formatStatusLabel`** centralised formatting of pipeline status labels (snake_case → readable), fixing inconsistency between graph nodes and side panel.

## Notes

This is the first public reference implementation of the CKS Studio Standard.
