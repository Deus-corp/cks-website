# Contributing to cks-mcp

Thank you for your interest in contributing!

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment: `python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate`
3. Install in editable mode: `pip install -e .[dev]`
4. Run tests: `python -m pytest -v`

Before opening a PR, also run the two checks CI enforces on every push —
passing tests alone isn't enough:

```bash
pip install ruff mypy types-requests
ruff check src/
mypy src/cks_mcp
```

## Adding a New Tool

A new tool touches exactly two places:

1. A new package under `src/cks_mcp/tools/<name>/` (or an existing one, if
   it belongs with a closely related tool — e.g. `tools/revert/` holds both
   `list_versions` and `revert_version`), containing:
   - `handler.py` — the async implementation function.
   - `schema.py` — a plain Python dict with `name`, `description`, and
     `inputSchema`. Use a dict rather than a literal `.json` file so shared
     description text (see `tools/_shared.py`) can be imported instead of
     duplicated.
   - `__init__.py` — re-exports the handler function(s), e.g.
     `from .handler import my_tool as my_tool`.
2. Its entry in the `TOOLS` dict in `src/cks_mcp/registry.py`, built from
   `**YOUR_TOOL_SCHEMA` plus the wired-up `handler`.

Wrap the handler with `_wrap`, `_wrap_session`, or `_wrap_open_session`
(see `registry.py`) rather than calling `log_tool_call()` directly —
this is what gives every tool its structured validation stack and
telemetry for free.

Mirror the layout in tests: add `tests/tools/<name>/test_handler.py`.

Once the tool works and is tested, add it to
[`docs/tools/`](docs/tools/index.md): pick the group file it fits best
(or start a new one), and add a row to the table in
[`docs/tools/index.md`](docs/tools/index.md) and to the
[README's tool table](README.md#available-tools). A tool without a
docs/tools/ entry is considered incomplete for review purposes.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix.
