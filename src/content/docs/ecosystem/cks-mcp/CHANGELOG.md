# Changelog


---

## [1.76.7] - 2026-08-19

### Added
- **Regression tests for version reconstruction errors** – `compare_versions` and `explain_diff` now have explicit coverage proving that reconstruction failures (e.g. `Object '...' already exists` during patch replay) surface as structured `{"error": ...}` responses rather than unhandled exceptions.

### Notes
- No production code changes; test coverage only.

---

## [1.76.6] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed
- **Google Gemini unsupported schema keywords** – `additionalProperties`, `$schema`, `$ref`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `allOf`, `default`, `examples`, `const`, `readOnly`, `writeOnly`, and `deprecated` are now stripped during Google provider schema normalization.
- **Google provider schema normalization** – `_normalize_schema_for_google()` now recursively removes unsupported keywords and collapses `anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf` to an empty object schema before building Gemini `functionDeclarations`. Source `inputSchema` objects remain unchanged.

### Added
- Regression tests verifying every registered tool schema normalizes to a Google-compatible shape and that source schemas remain untouched.

### Changed
- No changes to public MCP tool schemas or parameter semantics.

---

## [1.76.5] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed
- **Google `functionResponse.name`** – `ai_chat` now stamps `_google_tool_name` on `tool_result` blocks, and `_to_google_contents()` falls back to resolving the tool name from prior `tool_use` blocks by `tool_use_id`. This prevents Google Gemini from returning HTTP 400 `Name cannot be empty`.
- **Tool schema audit** – all registered tool schemas now pass strict JSON Schema validation: arrays declare `items` with `type`, simple object properties declare `type`, and zero-argument tools explicitly set `additionalProperties: false`.

### Added
- `tests/test_tool_schema_compliance.py` walks every registered tool schema and fails on missing `items`, missing property `type`, or ambiguous empty-object schemas.
- Regression tests for `functionResponse.name` resolution in Google tool calling.

### Changed
- No public API or parameter semantics changed.

---

## [1.76.4] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed
- **Google Gemini tool-calling schema validation** – `ai_chat` and `evolve_knowledge` schemas no longer send array parameters with missing/empty `items` to Google. Gemini requires `items.type`; the schemas now define it explicitly.
- **Google provider schema normalization** – added `_normalize_schema_for_google()` to recursively repair array schemas before building Gemini function declarations, preventing future schema regressions from breaking tool calling.

### Tests
- Added regression coverage for Gemini array-schema normalization and all registered tool schemas.
- Full suite green.

---

## [1.76.3] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed
- **Imports after cks-runtime restructure** – `server.py` and the standalone agents (`critic_agent`, `enrichment_agent`, `fork_resolution_agent`, `pipeline_agent`) now import `CksCoreAdapter` from `cks_runtime.adapters.cks_core` instead of the removed `cks_runtime_plugins.cks_core` path.
- **`clone_graph` hidden dependency** – `from cks.evolution import CanonicalRelation` is no longer relied upon. The handler now imports `CanonicalRelation` from its canonical home `cks.core`.
- Updated test imports and mock paths to match the new module layout of `cks-runtime` and `cks-core`.

### Tests
- 1121 passed, 6 skipped.

---

## [1.76.2] - 2026-08-19

### Changed
- **Internal package restructuring** – LLM providers moved into `cks_mcp.llm.providers` (one module per provider), HTTP transport modules into `cks_mcp.transport`, telemetry/observability into `cks_mcp.observability`, and standalone agents into `cks_mcp.agents`.
- `middleware.py` left in place because it is transport-agnostic and used by both stdio and HTTP paths.
- Updated console script entry points in `pyproject.toml` to the new module paths.
- Made provider imports in `LLMClient` lazy, resolving a latent circular import after the providers package was introduced.

### Fixed
- All internal imports and test mock paths updated to the new module layout.
- `ruff` and full test suite remain green.

### Tests
- 1121 passed, 6 skipped.

---

## [1.76.1] - 2026-08-19

### Fixed
- **Google provider gaps** – `ingest_document` with `use_llm=true` now routes through the native Google provider when `CKS_LLM_PROVIDER=google`, instead of raising `Unknown CKS_LLM_PROVIDER`.
- **`construct_knowledge` Google adapter** – added an explicit local `_call_google` / `_single_shot_google_adapter` wrapper, making Google dispatch consistent with other providers and testable.

### Added
- Tests for Google provider HTTP layer, tool-call round-tripping including `thought_signature`, `get_llm_status`, `list_llm_models`, `construct_knowledge`, and `ingest_document` LLM mode.
- Docs updated to include Google Gemini in README, getting-started, `ai-chat.md`, and `list-llm-models.md`.

### Changed
- `auto` provider selection never picks `google` or `openai_compatible` implicitly; both must be selected explicitly, matching existing convention.

---

## [1.76.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added
- **Native Google Gemini provider** – `CKS_LLM_PROVIDER=google` now selects Google Gemini directly, using the official Gemini `generateContent` / function-calling API. Supports:
  - `CKS_GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
  - `CKS_GOOGLE_MODEL` (default `gemini-2.5-flash`)
- **Tool calling for Google** – `LLMClient` now maps Anthropic-style tool calls to Gemini `functionDeclarations`/`functionCall` parts, including `thought_signature` handling.
- **`get_llm_status` / `list_llm_models` Google support** – provider status now reports `google` and `google_configured`; model listing returns a curated Google/Gemini model list.
- **Tests** – added coverage for Google provider dispatch, single-shot calls, tool calls, and provider status/model listing.

### Changed
- Provider routing now recognises `google` alongside `ollama`, `anthropic`, and `openai_compatible`.
- Google provider implemented via REST/urllib, matching the existing provider style with no new heavy dependency.

---

## [1.75.0] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- **`evolve_knowledge` resilience under concurrent writers** – increased commit retries from 2 to 5, added exponential backoff with jitter between retries, and added a conservative “already applied” idempotency check. If a concurrent writer has already committed the same Add/Remove operation, `evolve_knowledge` now returns a successful no-op instead of exhausting retries with `concurrent_modification`.
- **`list_processes` latency** – liveness pruning now runs as a background asyncio task with a 5-minute throttle instead of blocking every `list_processes` call. This eliminates occasional 10–30+ second stalls in `process_status`/`list_processes` polling.

### Added
- Regression tests for:
  - concurrent modification retry count and no-op behavior
  - non-blocking/throttled liveness pruning
  - prune re-run after the throttle window

### Changed
- `_MAX_COMMIT_RETRIES` raised to 5.
- `_IDEMPOTENCY_CHECKABLE_OPS` supports `AddObject`, `AddRelation`, `RemoveObject`, `RemoveRelation`.
- `prune_agent_liveness` call moved out of the hot request path.

---

## [1.74.1] - 2026-08-18

### Fixed
- **Circular import in LLM client** – `LLMClient.__init__` no longer references `llm_providers` functions as default argument values at class-definition time. Defaults are now resolved lazily inside `__init__`, preventing an `AttributeError`/circular-import failure when importing `cks_mcp.server` after recent `llm.redact` changes.

---

## [1.74.0] - 2026-08-18

### Added
- **Secret redaction** – new `cks_mcp.llm.redact` module with `redact_secret` and `scrub_secrets`; all provider error paths now scrub configured API keys/tokens before including response bodies in errors/logs.
- **LLM retry/backoff** – new `cks_mcp.llm.retry.call_with_retry` shared helper, applied to `call_ollama`, `call_anthropic`, `call_anthropic_with_tools`, `call_ollama_with_tools`, `call_openai_compatible_with_tools`, and `call_openai_compatible_single_shot`. Retries HTTP 429/529 and network-level failures with exponential backoff + jitter; non-retryable HTTP errors propagate immediately.
- **`list_llm_models` TTL cache** – new in-memory cache for model-list responses keyed by a provider-config fingerprint (excluding API keys). Default TTL 300s; `CKS_LLM_MODELS_TTL_SECONDS=0` disables caching. Repeated Studio polls now avoid re-querying the provider.

### Changed
- Provider error messages are now scrubbed of secret values before being logged or returned.
- LLM provider functions now delegate HTTP request execution to the shared retry helper.

### Tests
- Added tests for secret redaction, retry behavior, and model-list caching.

---

## [1.73.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- **Per-call model override for `ai_chat`** – `ai_chat` now accepts an optional `model` argument that overrides the provider's configured model for that single call. This enables cks-studio's Settings "Preferred model" field to influence LLM calls without changing server environment variables.
- **`LLMClient.call_with_tools` model override** – all provider routes (Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI-compatible) now accept an explicit `model` parameter with precedence over env defaults.

### Changed
- `ai_chat` schema documents the new optional `model` field.
- No change to provider selection; the new argument only affects the selected provider's model name.

### Tests
- Added unit tests for model override behavior across providers and fallback when omitted.

---

## [1.72.0] - 2026-08-17

### Added
- **Embedded agents** – the four standalone agents (`pipeline`, `critic`, `enrichment`, `fork_resolution`) can now run as in-process background asyncio tasks inside the main cks-mcp server, controlled by `CKS_EMBEDDED_AGENTS=true` or individual `CKS_EMBED_*_AGENT` flags.
- **`embedded_agents.py`** – manages agent startup/shutdown, passes each agent a shared `stop_event`, and gracefully stops them on server shutdown with a configurable timeout.
- **ADR-012 Embedded Agents** – documents the decision to run agents in-process rather than spawning subprocesses.

### Changed
- `server.py` now starts/stops embedded agents as part of the main runtime lifecycle.
- Each agent runner now accepts an optional external `stop_event` so it does not install its own SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers in embedded mode.

### Tests
- Existing agent and server tests remain green; new coverage added where practical for embedded-agent gating/startup.

---

## [1.71.2] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- **Shared hash-mismatch recovery in read handlers** – `compare_versions`, `explain_diff`, and MCP resource version reads now use `cks_runtime.session.reconstruct_with_retry` to recover from a stale session and retry version reconstruction once after a reload.
- **`resources.py` version endpoint** – version resource reads are now async and use the shared retry path.
- **Version reconstruction consistency** – tool handlers and resources now handle hash-mismatch `ValueError` the same way as `OutboxEmbeddingWorker`.

---

## [1.71.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- **Pipeline step idempotency** – `ResearcherStep` and `ReviewerStep` now reload the session before checking idempotency, so a step already completed by another process is detected and skipped instead of failing with `Object '...' already exists`.
- **Race handling after commit** – if an `evolve_knowledge` call still loses a race and returns “already exists”, pipeline steps now treat that as a completed transition and continue to the next stage instead of failing the outbox task.
- **Blind exception handling** – added a targeted `# noqa: BLE001` for a defensive session-refresh fallback in `pipeline/common.py`.

### Changed
- Refactored shared idempotency helpers in `src/cks_mcp/pipeline/common.py`.
- Extended transition-log metadata checks used by researcher/reviewer steps.

### Tests
- Added regression tests for researcher-step idempotency and race recovery.

---

## [1.71.0] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- **Enrichment agent idempotency** – when the same document URL is already present in the session (e.g. from a previous enrichment or retry), the agent now reuses the existing Document node instead of trying to `add_object` it again. This eliminates `Object '...' already exists` retry loops.
- **Fork resolution agent idempotency** – LCA resolution objects are no longer re-written when they already exist in the session; deterministic resolution ids are checked before `evolve_knowledge`.
- **Critic agent task overlap** – added `CKS_CRITIC_TASK_TYPES` environment override so `crdt_fork` (or any task type) can be carved out of the Critic Agent’s claim set, preventing it from racing the dedicated Fork Resolution Agent.

### Added
- `CKS_CRITIC_TASK_TYPES` env var for configuring which outbox task types the Critic Agent claims.
- Regression tests for enrichment doc-id collision, LCA idempotency, and task-type narrowing.

### Changed
- `CriticAgentSettings` now stores `task_types`; `run_once` iterates only those types.

---

## [1.70.1] - 2026-08-17

### Fixed
- **`ai_chat` iteration-limit flag** – when the tool-call iteration cap is reached, `ai_chat` now includes `"truncated": true` in its response alongside the human-readable message, so clients like cks-studio can detect and retry this specific, retriable condition without string-matching text.
- **`evolve_knowledge` invalid operations** – passing `operations` as a JSON string or non-array now returns a structured `invalid_operations` error instead of an opaque `internal_error` from an unhandled `AttributeError`.

### Added
- Regression tests for:
  - `truncated` flag on iteration-limit responses
  - `evolve_knowledge` rejecting `operations` as a string or dict

---

## [1.70.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- **Dead-letter session filter** – `list_dead_lettered_conflicts` now accepts an optional `session_id`, so cks-studio can show only dead-letter tasks for the current session.
- **Agent liveness pruning hook** – `list_processes` now calls `prune_agent_liveness` on the storage backend, removing stale standalone-agent liveness rows (default 7 days) before returning the process list.

### Changed
- Tool schemas updated for dead-letter filtering.
- Improved process listing to prune old process entries automatically.

### Tests
- Existing and newly added tests for dead-letter filtering and process pruning pass.

---

## [1.69.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed
- **Stale session reads in multi-process agent setups** – added `refresh_session_from_storage` middleware and a shared session-refresh helper. Session-scoped MCP tool calls now reload persisted session state before running, so the main cks-mcp process no longer serves stale in-memory snapshots when a standalone agent process (e.g. `cks-pipeline-agent`, Critic, Enrichment) has already committed changes to the same SQLite/Postgres backend.
- **Research loop stuck on Queued** – `list_pipeline_runs` / `query_subgraph` / `serialize_knowledge` can now see transition-log updates written by a separate pipeline-agent process, so runs progress from `Queued` instead of appearing frozen.
- **Evolve retry path** now reuses the shared `reload_session_from_storage` helper.

### Added
- `cks_mcp.session_refresh` module centralising in-place session reload from persisted storage.
- Tests for middleware and session-refresh behavior.

---

## [1.69.0] - 2026-08-16

### Added
- **`unregister_graph` tool** – removes a registered graph from the graph registry by name. The underlying session and knowledge structure are left untouched.
- **Tool count** – increased from 70 to 71.

### Changed
- `registry.py` now registers `unregister_graph` under the Memory & Persistence group.
- Documentation updated to reflect the new tool and total count.

### Tests
- Added handler tests for `unregister_graph`, covering success, missing name, and graph-not-found cases.

---

## [1.68.2] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed
- **Claim integrity alias** – restored `claim_integrity` mapping in `EXTENSION_ALIASES` if it was missing, ensuring `validate_knowledge` and `evolve_knowledge` correctly resolve the extension.

---

## [1.68.1] - 2026-08-16

### Fixed
- **Pipeline LLM provider dispatch** – `pipeline/common.py` now routes through the shared `LLMClient` instead of its own hand-rolled `ollama`/`anthropic`/`auto`-only dispatch. This fixes `CKS_LLM_PROVIDER=openai_compatible` being rejected as “Unknown CKS_LLM_PROVIDER” inside Researcher/Reviewer/Synthesizer/Arbiter pipeline steps, while `get_llm_status` and `construct_knowledge` already recognized it.
- **Pipeline provider consistency** – all pipeline LLM calls now behave like the rest of cks-mcp: `auto`, `ollama`, `anthropic`, and `openai_compatible` all work the same way.

### Added
- Regression test for `openai_compatible` dispatch from pipeline `call_llm`.

---

## [1.68.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **`update_graph_lifecycle` tool** – transitions a registered graph’s lifecycle state (`draft`, `published`, `active`, `stale`, `under_review`, `archived`) with a validated transition matrix.
- **Lifecycle-aware registry** – `get_graph` / `list_graphs` now return `lifecycle_state`, defaulting to `published` for public graphs and `draft` otherwise.
- **Transition validation** – disallowed transitions return a structured `invalid_state_transition` error with the allowed next states; requesting the current state is a no-op.
- **Documentation** – updated tool count (70) and added a full section with the allowed-transition table.
- **Tests** – 29 new cases covering missing/invalid params, not-found, full transition matrix, disallowed transitions, terminal `archived`, no-op same-state, and missing-lifecycle defaults.

### Changed
- Tool count increased from 69 to 70.
- `registry.py` now registers `update_graph_lifecycle`.

---

## [1.67.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **`claim_integrity` extension alias** – `validate_knowledge` and `evolve_knowledge` now resolve the extension name `claim_integrity` to `CKS-EXT-CLAIM-INTEGRITY`, enabling Claim shape/consistency validation on demand.
- **Claim validation docs** – `validate_knowledge` schema now includes a valid Claim example, and `evolve_knowledge` schema notes that adding/editing Claim objects is only checked when `claim_integrity` is requested.
- **Tests** – integration coverage for valid/invalid Claims through both `validate_knowledge` and `evolve_knowledge`, with and without the extension.

### Changed
- No production behavior change unless `claim_integrity` is explicitly passed in `extensions`.

---

## [1.66.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **`list_pipeline_runs` tool** – read-only reconstruction of ADR-007 pipeline runs for a session, grouped by `run_id`. Returns per-run status, timestamps, object ids, and per-step details (Researcher → Synthesizer → Reviewer → Arbiter) with step status, timestamps, errors, and dead-letter task ids.
- **Pipeline run tracking** – `start_pipeline` now stamps `run_id` into outbox payloads; `ResearcherStep` and `ReviewerStep` thread it through transition logs and subsequent outbox tasks, enabling reconstruction of runs from existing persisted data.
- **Transition schema extension** – `append_transition` and `TransitionEntry` now support an optional `run_id` field.

### Changed
- `start_pipeline` payload format now includes `run_id` (backward-compatible: absent run_id is treated as no run lineage).
- `README` updated to reflect 69 tools.

### Tests
- Added integration tests for `list_pipeline_runs` covering empty sessions, runs derived from transition logs, queued runs from pending outbox tasks, failed runs from dead-letter tasks, session filtering, limit, contract shape, and unsupported-outbox backends.
- Updated `start_pipeline` tests for run_id in payloads.

---

## [1.65.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **`compare_graphs`** – read-only diff between two registered graphs or sessions, reporting shared object ids, unique-to-each-side ids, and structural differences for shared objects.
- **`merge_graphs`** – three-way merge of two graphs into a new session using `KnowledgeStructure.merge()`. Supports an optional common ancestor, per-object resolutions, and optional registration of the merged result.
- **`link_graphs`** – creates a deterministic cross-graph relation between an object in graph A and an object in graph B, writing the relation to both source sessions and adding local copies of remote participants when needed for referential integrity.
- **Graph resolution helper** – shared `graph_resolution.py` for resolving graph names or session ids consistently across the new tools.
- **Documentation** – updated README and tool docs for the new tools and tool count (68 tools).

### Changed
- Tool count increased from 65 to 68.
- `test_server.py` updated to assert 68 tools.

### Tests
- Added integration tests for `compare_graphs`, `merge_graphs`, and `link_graphs` covering resolution by name/session, diff shape, merge success/conflict, link creation, missing objects, duplicate relations, and source graph immutability.

---

## [1.64.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **Graph visibility and team scoping** – `register_graph`, `list_graphs`, `search_graphs`, and `update_registered_graph` now support `visibility` (`private` | `team` | `public`) and an optional `team` namespace. The old `public` flag remains supported for backward compatibility.
- **Team filter** – `list_graphs` and `search_graphs` can filter by `team`.
- **Schema propagation** – storage backends from `cks-runtime` now persist `visibility` and `team`.

### Changed
- `update_registered_graph` preserves visibility/team when re-registering graphs.
- Tool schemas and handlers updated to accept and return the new fields.

### Tests
- Full test suite is green (`922 passed / 6 skipped`), including new tests for team registration, invalid visibility rejection, and re-register lineage/visibility preservation.

---

## [1.63.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **Graph clone lineage** – `clone_graph` and `register_graph` now support `source_graph_name`, recording the registered name of the graph a clone was forked from. This enables “forked from X” lineage in the graph registry and gallery.

### Changed
- `register_graph` accepts an optional `source_graph_name` argument and passes it through to storage backends that support it (SQLite, Postgres, InMemory).
- `clone_graph` now records lineage when cloning by `graph_name` and registering under `copy_name`.

### Tests
- Added coverage for lineage recording in clone, re-register preservation, and `source_graph_name` argument in `register_graph`.

---

## [1.62.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **`clone_graph` tool** – creates a new session containing a copy of an existing registered graph (or any live session). Supports `graph_name` or `source_session_id`, optional `target_session_id` for merging into an existing session, and optional `copy_name`/`description`/`tags`/`public` to register the clone. The source session is never modified.
- **Tests** – integration coverage for cloning by name/session, merging into target, copy registration, missing source errors, and source immutability.

### Changed
- Tool count increased from 64 to 65.
- Documentation updated (`docs/tools/index.md`, README).

---

## [1.61.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added
- **HTTP token authentication** – optional `CKS_MCP_HTTP_TOKEN` for the HTTP transport. When set, both `POST /mcp` and `GET /events`/`GET /events/{session_id}` require a matching token, either via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` or `?token=<token>` (needed for browser `EventSource`).
- **`http_auth.py`** – constant-time token comparison using `hmac.compare_digest` to avoid timing leaks.
- **Tests** – unit/integration coverage for enabled/disabled auth, bearer header and query token paths, missing/invalid token rejection.

### Changed
- `server.py` now installs an `aiohttp` auth middleware on the HTTP application.
- `http_events.py` performs a defensive auth check as well as relying on middleware.
- Documentation updated in README and `docs/security.md` for HTTP transport security.

---

## [1.60.0] - 2026-08-14

### Added
- **SSE real-time event streaming** – new optional HTTP endpoint `GET /events` and `GET /events/{session_id}` over Server-Sent Events, broadcasting runtime lifecycle events (`SessionCreated`, `VersionCreated`, `TransactionCommitted`, `GossipConflictDetected`, `CRDTForkDetected`, etc.) so thin clients like cks-studio can react live instead of polling.
- **SSE filtering** – supports optional `?event_types=A,B` query param and path/query `session_id` filtering.
- **SSEBroadcaster** – internal bridge between `Runtime` EventBus and HTTP subscribers with bounded queues and slow-consumer drop-oldest policy.
- **Documentation** – README and security docs updated for HTTP transport and SSE endpoint.

### Changed
- `pytest-aiohttp` added to dev dependencies for SSE integration tests.
- ROADMAP updated: Real MCP Session Presence marked in progress.

---

## [1.59.0] - 2026-08-13

### Added
- **`start_pipeline` tool** – new MCP tool that enqueues `pipeline_research_request` outbox tasks for selected session objects, enabling cks-studio to start an ADR-007 agent pipeline run from the graph UI. Supports `session_id`, optional `object_ids`, `mode`, `parent_session_id` for Phase 1 sandbox isolation, and `schema_version`. Returns `run_id`, `enqueued_objects`, `status`. Tool count increased from 63 to 64.

---

## [1.58.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- **Phase 1 safety infrastructure** – automatic `fork_sandbox` isolation, token/cost budgeting (`TokenBudget`), idempotency cache (hash‑based dedup of pipeline runs), and graceful degradation (stop on first failure, leave sandbox for manual analysis).
- `run_sequential` and `run_concurrent` now accept optional `parent_session_id`, `object_ids`, and `schema_version` to opt into Phase 1 isolation.

---

## [1.57.3] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- **ArbiterStep** – terminal pipeline agent (ADR-007 Milestone 2) that consumes `contradiction_detected` outbox tasks, asks an LLM to pick the best-supported relation based on provenance, and removes the losing relations. Completes the Researcher → Synthesizer → Reviewer → Arbiter pipeline.
- `AWAITING_ARBITRATION` and `RESOLVED` statuses in pipeline schema.
- Unit tests for ArbiterStep.

---

## [1.57.2] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- **SynthesizerStep** – new pipeline agent step (ADR-007 Milestone 2) that takes a set of raw facts, asks an LLM to deduplicate and reconcile them, and commits the synthesized subgraph via `evolve_knowledge`. The synthesized node is then automatically enqueued for review by the existing Reviewer step.
- **`pipeline_agent.py`** now includes SynthesizerStep alongside Researcher and Reviewer.
- Unit tests for SynthesizerStep.

---

## [1.57.1] - 2026-08-11

### Added
- **`check_component_versions` now supports JS/TS components** – when a Component object has `version_source: "package.json"` in its structure, the tool fetches `package.json` from GitHub raw and reads the `"version"` field instead of looking for `_version.py`. This allows `cks-studio` and other non-Python components to be properly version‑checked.

---

## [1.57.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **`list_llm_models` tool** – returns the list of available models for the current LLM provider (Ollama via `/api/tags`, Anthropic and OpenAI-compatible via hardcoded lists). Provider resolution mirrors `get_llm_status`.
- Tool count increased from 62 to 63.

---

## [1.56.2] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **OpenAI-compatible single‑shot support** – `construct_knowledge`, `arbitrate_inference_conflict`, and `resolve_gossip_conflict` now work with `CKS_LLM_PROVIDER=openai_compatible`. New function `call_openai_compatible_single_shot` in `llm_providers.py`.
- **`LLMClient.call_single_shot`** – unified text‑in/text‑out LLM call across all providers (Ollama, Anthropic, OpenAI‑compatible), replacing the ad‑hoc dispatch in `construct_knowledge`.
- **`openai_compatible_configured` field** in `get_llm_status` – reports whether `CKS_OPENAI_API_KEY` is set.

### Changed
- `construct_knowledge`, `arbitrate_inference_conflict`, `resolve_gossip_conflict` now route through `LLMClient` instead of private provider functions.
- `get_llm_status` now recognises `openai_compatible` as a known explicit provider.

### Fixed
- `LLMClient` single‑shot methods reuse the existing injectable function pattern for testability, preserving backward compatibility with tests that patch `_call_anthropic` etc.

---

## [1.56.1] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **OpenAI-compatible provider** – `ai_chat` now supports `CKS_LLM_PROVIDER=openai_compatible` for any OpenAI-compatible API (OpenAI, Groq, DeepSeek, Together, LM Studio, vLLM, etc.). New env vars: `CKS_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `CKS_OPENAI_API_KEY`, `CKS_OPENAI_MODEL`.
- `call_openai_compatible_with_tools` – translates between OpenAI and Anthropic message/tool shapes.

---

## [1.56.0] - 2026-08-10

### Added
- **Ollama support for `ai_chat`** – the `ai_chat` tool now routes through the same provider selection as `construct_knowledge` (`CKS_LLM_PROVIDER=auto|ollama|anthropic`). Ollama tool‑calling uses the `/api/chat` endpoint with a translation layer that normalises responses into the Anthropic content‑block envelope, so the `ai_chat` loop remains provider‑agnostic.
- **Shared LLM client** (`cks_mcp.llm.client.LLMClient`) – encapsulates provider selection and tool‑calling dispatch, with fakes injectable for testing.
- **`call_ollama_with_tools`** in `llm_providers.py` – translates between Ollama and Anthropic message/tool shapes.
- **`get_llm_status` tool** – reports which LLM provider is currently selected, whether it's reachable/configured, and which model it would use. Read‑only, no chat calls. Exists so a thin client (cks‑studio Settings page) can show provider status without ever seeing API keys.
- New unit tests for the LLM client, Ollama tool‑calling, provider‑routing in `ai_chat`, and `get_llm_status`.
- Tool count increased from 61 to 62.

---

## [1.55.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- **`ai_chat` tool** – sends a chat turn to an LLM (Anthropic API only for now) that can call any safe MCP tool. Implements a bounded agentic loop (max 8 iterations) with session pinning, denylist for server-management tools, and stateless message history.
- **`call_anthropic_with_tools`** – new function in `llm_providers.py` for tool-use calls.
- Tool count increased from 60 to 61.
- New unit tests for `ai_chat`.

---

## [1.54.1] - 2026-08-09

### Fixed
- **Closed leaked gossip HTTP transport** – `GossipHandle.stop()` now explicitly closes the `HTTPGossipTransport`, preventing "Unclosed client session" warnings on shutdown. This is the production-side fix matching the same leak already fixed in `cks-runtime` demo scripts.

---

## [1.54.0] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- **`start_agent` and `stop_agent` tools** – start or stop an in‑process sweeper (contradiction, inference staleness, etc.) at runtime via the `cks_sweeper_control` table (ADR-015). The override persists across server restarts.
- **`request_process_stop` tool** – request a graceful shutdown of a standalone agent process (Critic, Enrichment, Fork Resolution, Pipeline) by setting `desired_state='stop_requested'` in its liveness row (ADR-016).
- **`LivenessReporter` now supports remote stop** – when a `stop_event` is provided, the background tick reads its own liveness row and sets the event if `desired_state` is `'stop_requested'`, converging remote stop with SIGTERM.
- **Backdated heartbeat on graceful exit** – `LivenessReporter.stop()` writes a last heartbeat at epoch so that a cleanly exited process reads as `stopped` immediately rather than after the TTL window.
- Tool count increased from 57 to 60.
- New unit tests for all three tools.

---

## [1.53.3] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- Unit tests for `list_processes` and `process_status` MCP tools (11 tests).

---

## [1.53.2] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- **`list_processes` tool** – returns liveness status of all standalone agent processes (Critic, Enrichment, Fork Resolution, Pipeline) that have ever reported to the `cks_agent_liveness` table.
- **`process_status` tool** – returns detailed status of the most recent instance of a given process kind.
- Tool count increased from 55 to 57.

---

## [1.53.1] - 2026-08-09

### Added
- **`list_agents` tool** – returns all known in‑process sweepers (contradiction, inference staleness, provenance staleness, temporal staleness, graph freshness, graph auto‑update, graph health) with their agent_id, kind, running status, and interval. Standalone agent processes (critic, enrichment, fork resolution, pipeline) are not included – they run in separate OS processes.
- **`agent_status` tool** – returns detailed status for a single sweeper by agent_id, including last run timestamp, duration, result count, and last error.
- Tool count increased from 53 to 55.

---

## [1.53.0] - 2026-08-08

### Added
- **`query_subgraph` now supports empty `seed_ids`** — returns the full knowledge graph when no seeds are provided, allowing `cks-studio` and other clients to load an entire session without resorting to `serialize_knowledge`. This is a separate code path that builds the result directly from the session's structure rather than loosening `cks-core`'s BFS requirement.
- **New tests** for `query_subgraph` without `seed_ids` covering both default and `compact_mode` output shapes.

### Changed
- **Canonical node shape in `compact_mode`** — `query_subgraph`, `visualize_graph`, and `lca_arbiter` now always use the canonical `{"identity": {...}, "structure": {...}}` shape for compact nodes, replacing the legacy `{"id": ..., "type": ..., "name": ..., "props": {...}}` format. This unifies the output with `serialize_knowledge` and eliminates the need for frontend adapters.

### Fixed
- **`lca_arbiter` tests** updated to reflect the canonical node shape.
- **`visualize_graph`** correctly reads node identity and label from the new shape.

---

## [1.52.3] - 2026-08-08

### Added
- **Optional HTTP transport** – `cks-mcp` can now serve MCP requests over HTTP when `CKS_MCP_HTTP_PORT` is set. Starts an `aiohttp` server on the given port alongside the existing stdio transport, with CORS support for local development. Enables direct integration with web-based frontends like `cks-studio`.
- **`aiohttp-cors` dependency** added to `pyproject.toml` (required for HTTP transport CORS middleware).

### Changed
- Imports in `server.py` refactored to avoid `ruff` warnings and `aiohttp` namespace issues.

---

## [1.52.2] - 2026-08-07

### Changed
- **Refactored pipeline step code** – extracted shared helpers (`find_object`, `content_hash`, `call_llm`) from `researcher_step.py` and `reviewer_step.py` into `pipeline/common.py` to eliminate code duplication. Both step modules now import from the common module.
- **`reviewer_step.py`** – re-enqueues rejected objects onto the Researcher's queue, preventing stranded objects. Idempotent skip paths now correctly resume pipeline routing instead of silently dropping tasks.
- **`orchestrator.py`** – removed dead `session_id` field from `PipelineContext` and constructor. `run_concurrent` now isolates per‑step infrastructure failures so one step's crash doesn't cancel sibling drain cycles.
- **`StepResult`** now reports `abandoned` and `error` fields, separating lease‑lost tasks from successfully processed ones.
- **Linear scan replaced with indexed lookup** in `find_object` (O(1) via `KnowledgeStructure.get()` when available).

### Fixed
- Monkeypatch targets in tests updated to match new function names and signatures.

---

## [1.52.1] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- **Stuck pipeline after idempotent retry** – `ResearcherStep` and `ReviewerStep` now correctly enqueue the next stage's outbox task even when the step itself is skipped due to idempotency (content hash already present). Previously, a retry after a crash (or a Reviewer sending an object back for re‑research) would leave the pipeline with no task in any queue, permanently stranding the object. The reviewer also now re‑enqueues rejected objects onto the Researcher's queue, so a `NEEDS_RESEARCH` verdict actually triggers a new research cycle.
- **Updated regression tests** – tests now assert the correct enqueue behavior for idempotent and rejection paths.

---

## [1.52.0] - 2026-08-07

### Added
- **CKSAgentOrchestrator (ADR-007 Milestone 1)** – new `src/cks_mcp/orchestrator.py` with `PipelineContext`, `AgentStep` protocol, and `CKSAgentOrchestrator.run_sequential`/`run_concurrent`. Agents communicate through the persistent outbox and CRDT registers, reusing the existing claim/complete/fail/dead-letter machinery. Publishes `AgentStepStarted`/`AgentStepCompleted` events (requires `cks-runtime >= 1.48.5`).
- **Pipeline schema** (`src/cks_mcp/pipeline/schema.py`) – `PipelineStatus` constants, `append_transition`, `read_status`, `read_transition_log`, and `has_agent_transitioned` helpers that use `evolve_knowledge` to write structured transition records as knowledge objects.
- **ResearcherStep** and **ReviewerStep** (`src/cks_mcp/pipeline/researcher_step.py`, `reviewer_step.py`) – first concrete `AgentStep` implementations with idempotency-by-content-hash, LLM calls via the existing provider dispatch, and atomic `evolve_knowledge` commits.
- **`cks-pipeline-agent` console script** – entry point for running a pipeline of agents, registered in `pyproject.toml`.
- **Regression tests** – 27 new tests covering orchestrator, pipeline schema, and step implementations.

### Changed
- **`create_fork.py`** – simplified nested `if` statement for ruff compliance.

### Fixed
- **ruff warnings** in `create_fork.py`, `orchestrator.py`, `researcher_step.py`, and `reviewer_step.py`.

---

## [1.51.3] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- **Race condition on `.write_test` in `server.py`** – when two `cks-mcp` instances shared the same parent directory (e.g. `/tmp/cks-a.db` and `/tmp/cks-b.db` both under `/tmp`), they used a single hardcoded `.write_test` file. One process could delete the file before the other finished its test, causing a spurious "not writable" fallback to a temporary database. Now each process uses a unique filename (`.write_test_<pid>`) to avoid the race.
- **`create_fork.py` now accepts `session_id` and `db_path` as command-line arguments** instead of hardcoding outdated values, eliminating the `session_not_found` error when running the script after a fresh session creation.

---

## [1.51.2] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- **CRDT store now shares the storage backend's thread lock** – `_build_crdt_store` (in `gossip.py`) and `_crdt_store_for` (in `critic_agent.py` and `fork_resolution_agent.py`) now pass the owning `SQLiteStorage`'s `threading.RLock` to `SQLiteCRDTStore`. This prevents concurrent access corruption when the gossip adapter, fork agent, and background embedding worker all touch the same SQLite connection simultaneously (previously each component used an independent lock, which didn't serialize access to the shared connection). Requires `cks-runtime >= 1.48.3`.

---

## [1.51.1] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- **Main server now respects `CKS_MCP_DB_PATH`** – `server.py` previously ignored the environment variable `CKS_MCP_DB_PATH` and always used `~/.cks-mcp/cks_mcp.db`. Companion agents (`cks-fork-agent`, `cks-critic-agent`, `cks-enrichment-agent`) followed the documented env-var override, causing the server and agents to silently operate on different databases when `CKS_MCP_DB_PATH` was set. Now `server.py` reads `CKS_MCP_DB_PATH` first (with `data_dir()/cks_mcp.db` fallback), matching the agents' behavior. A warning is logged when an explicit `CKS_MCP_DB_PATH` is unwritable, and the startup log always reports the resolved database path.
- **Plugin lifecycle is fully async** – `CksPlugin.setup()` / `teardown()` and `PluginRegistry.setup_all()` / `teardown_all()` are now awaited in `server.py`, preventing a bug where `GossipPlugin.setup()` could silently fail due to an `asyncio.run()` call inside a running event loop (already fixed in v1.51.0, but the await was missing in `main()`).
- **Regression tests** added for `CKS_MCP_DB_PATH` resolution consistency across server, fork agent, and critic agent.

---

## [1.51.0] - 2026-08-07

### Fixed
- **Plugin lifecycle is now fully async** — `CksPlugin.setup()` / `teardown()` and `PluginRegistry.setup_all()` / `teardown_all()` are now `async def`, fixing a subtle bug where `GossipPlugin` called `asyncio.run(handle.start())` from inside `server.py`'s already-running event loop. This raised a swallowed `RuntimeError`, so gossip never actually started whenever `CKS_GOSSIP_ENABLED=true` was set. All plugins now use `await` directly — no second event loop, no silent failures.

### Changed
- `FastEmbedPlugin` and `GossipPlugin` updated to the new async signatures.
- `server.py` now awaits `registry.setup_all()` / `registry.teardown_all()`.
- All plugin tests updated to `async` and a new regression test verifies that `GossipPlugin.setup()` works from inside a running event loop.

---

## [1.50.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added
- **LCA Arbiter** (`src/cks_mcp/lca_arbiter.py`) – a topology-aware fork resolution policy that analyses the Knowledge Graph structure before picking a winner. It finds the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of conflicting objects via `query_subgraph`, extracts each branch's delta, and classifies conflicts as `non_overlapping`, `competing_claims`, or `erroneous_branch`. When both branches are valid and disjoint, they are merged automatically; when one branch fails validation, the other wins; otherwise a `Resolution` knowledge object is created with `depends_on` on both branches for a human/Critic Agent to review.
- **LCA integration in ForkResolutionAgent** – new optional `use_lca` flag in `ForkResolutionAgentSettings` (default `true`). When enabled, the agent attempts LCA arbitration before falling back to the mechanical `VersionVector`/`created_at`/alphabetical tie-break.
- New unit tests in `tests/test_lca_arbiter.py` covering `find_lca`, `extract_delta`, `classify_conflict`, `_branch_is_valid`, `resolve_with_lca`, and `_build_resolution_object`.

---

## [1.49.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added
- **`ForkResolutionAgent` (Stage 3)** – new `src/cks_mcp/fork_resolution_agent.py`, a standalone autonomous process (console script `cks-fork-agent`) that claims and resolves `crdt_fork` outbox tasks on its own, following the same claim → resolve → complete/fail/dead-letter pattern as `critic_agent.py`/`enrichment_agent.py` (`cks_mcp.agents.agent_loop`). Resolution policy: (1) prefer the causally-newest object per `VersionVector`/`causality_check` when one candidate strictly dominates the others; (2) otherwise fall back to the most recent `created_at` on the live MV-Register pointer row; (3) otherwise a deterministic alphabetically-first `object_id` tie-break. Purely mechanical — no LLM involved.
- `ForkResolutionAgentSettings.from_env()` reads `CKS_FORK_AGENT_POLL_INTERVAL` (default 30s), `CKS_FORK_AGENT_MAX_RETRIES` (default 3), `CKS_FORK_AGENT_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` (default 60s), and shares `CKS_MCP_DB_PATH` with the other agents.
- New tests in `tests/test_fork_resolution_agent.py`.
- `cks-fork-agent = "cks_mcp.agents.fork_resolution_agent.fork_resolution_agent:main_sync"` entry point in `pyproject.toml`.

### Note
- `critic_agent.py`'s own `resolve_crdt_fork` (added in 1.48.0) still claims from the same `crdt_fork` outbox queue with a different (simpler, lexicographically-last) policy. Running both `cks-critic-agent` and `cks-fork-agent` at once means whichever claims a given fork first decides its outcome. Treat `cks-fork-agent` as the intended replacement for crdt_fork handling going forward — see README.md's "Fork Resolution Agent" section.

---

## [1.48.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added
- **CRDT fork resolution in Critic Agent** – `critic_agent.py` now handles `crdt_fork` tasks (escalated by `CRDTForkDetected` events, cks‑runtime ADR‑013 Stage 2). The resolver fetches the conflicting object ids from the event payload, uses `resolve_contradiction`-style mechanical logic to select a winner, and commits the resolution through `CRDTStore.resolve_pointer`.
- **CRDT fork subscriptions** – `gossip.py` now constructs a `CRDTStore` instance (when the storage backend supports it) and subscribes to `CRDTForkDetected` events, routing them into the `ConflictInbox` alongside gossip and inference conflicts.
- **`ConflictInbox` extended** – new `_CRDTForkRecord` and `record_crdt_fork`/`list_crdt_forks` methods for buffering and draining CRDT fork events, mirroring the existing gossip/inference conflict queues.
- New tests in `tests/test_critic_agent.py` for `resolve_crdt_fork`.
- Requires `cks‑runtime` ≥ 1.46.0 for `CRDTForkDetected.conflict_event_id`.

### Changed
- `ConflictInbox` and `gossip.py` updated to handle the new event type.

---

## [1.47.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added
- **`check_graph_health` tool** – computes an aggregate health score (0.0–1.0) for a registered graph by combining five existing read-only checks into one weighted metric: version freshness (`check_component_versions`, weight 0.3), TTL freshness (`check_graph_freshness`, weight 0.1), contradictions (`detect_contradictions`, weight 0.3), verification coverage (share of `VerificationRecord` objects checked within the last 30 days, weight 0.2), and dead‑lettered conflict tasks for the graph's session (`list_dead_lettered_conflicts`, weight 0.1). Read‑only — does not modify the graph or apply any fixes. Pairs with `GraphHealthSweeper` (cks‑runtime ≥ 1.44.0) which runs the same scoring on a schedule and escalates unhealthy graphs.
- Tool count increased from 52 to 53 (`test_server.py` updated). New unit tests in `tests/tools/check_graph_health/test_handler.py` covering perfect health, degraded health with weighted‑average verification, dead‑letter filtering by session, unsupported storage fallback, and malformed `checked_at` timestamps.

---

## [1.46.0] - 2026-08-06

### Added
- **LLM cost & token tracking** (`src/cks_mcp/llm_telemetry.py`) – new process‑level `LLMTelemetry` aggregator that records every LLM provider call made through `llm_providers` (Ollama/Anthropic). Tracks total calls, calls by provider/model/tool, total tokens, estimated cost (USD, Anthropic only – standard Sonnet $3/$15 and Opus $15/$75 per 1M input/output tokens; Ollama always $0), average duration, success rate, and top error types. Wired into `get_metrics` as a new `llm_telemetry` field alongside `runtime_metrics`, `tool_telemetry`, and `critic_agent_metrics`.
- **`tool_name` parameter on `call_ollama`/`call_anthropic`** – optional (default `None` preserves the old signature). When a caller passes its own name (e.g. `construct_knowledge`, `arbitrate_inference_conflict`, `resolve_gossip_conflict`, `update_registered_graph`, `enrichment_agent`), every outcome is recorded: for Anthropic, real `usage.input_tokens`/`usage.output_tokens` and their exact cost; for Ollama, a character‑based estimate (chars/4). Recording is best‑effort and never raises.
- Internal‑only `_tool_name` override in `construct_knowledge` and `ingest_document` so callers that invoke those handlers as plain Python functions (`update_registered_graph`, `enrichment_agent`) attribute their LLM calls correctly.
- New tests in `tests/test_llm_telemetry.py` (aggregation, cost estimation, ring‑buffer eviction), `tests/test_llm_providers.py` (tool‑name integration for every success/failure branch), and `tests/tools/get_metrics/test_handler.py` (verifies the new `llm_telemetry` field).

---

## [1.45.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **Human-in-the-loop dead-letter recovery** – three new mechanical (no-LLM) MCP tools for reviewing, approving, and rejecting dead-lettered conflict tasks, replacing the previous workflow that required hand-crafting resolution-tool calls with the correct parameters:
  - `review_dead_letter(task_id)` – looks up a DEAD-lettered task and proposes a ready-to-apply `{tool, arguments}` resolution based on its `task_type`, mirroring the Critic Agent's own per-type resolvers. Read-only, never applies anything.
  - `approve_resolution(task_id, resolution)` – validates that `resolution.tool` matches the task's `task_type`, calls the resolution tool with the given arguments, and (only on success) marks the task complete via `complete_conflict_task`. On failure the task stays DEAD.
  - `reject_resolution(task_id, reason?)` – annotates the task's `last_error` with the human's reason and leaves it DEAD for another reviewer.
- Requires `cks-runtime` ≥ 1.43.0 for `OutboxTask.last_error`.
- Tool count increased from 49 to 52 (`test_server.py` updated). New tests in `tests/tools/review_dead_letter/`, `tests/tools/approve_resolution/`, and `tests/tools/reject_resolution/`.

---

## [1.44.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **`explain_graph` tool** – generates a human-readable Markdown report for any registered ecosystem graph (Memory Agent v1). Walks the session's `knowledge_structure.objects`, groups entities by `identity.type` (Component, Module, StorageBackend, Sweeper, Agent, Tool, ADR, Plugin, Interface, Task), resolves relations to link modules/ADRs to their parent components, shows sweeper resolutions, agent responsibilities, tool categories, plugin status, and flags dangling relations as anomalies. Purely mechanical — no LLM calls, no network requests. Makes knowledge graphs accessible to any LLM (or person) without parsing raw JSON.
- Tool count increased from 48 to 49 (`test_server.py` updated).
- New unit tests in `tests/tools/explain_graph/test_handler.py` covering missing name, graph not found, session unavailable, full report with all sections, empty graph, and unrecognised object types.

---

## [1.43.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **`update_registered_graph` tool** – brings a registered ecosystem graph back in sync with the real code it describes. Internally calls `check_component_versions`; if every `Component` is already current, this is a no‑op. Otherwise, for each outdated component, it asks `construct_knowledge` to turn the release description into CKS objects, merges them into the graph session via `evolve_knowledge`, patches the stale component's own `version` field, and re‑registers the graph under the same name. Returns `{"updated": false, "reason": "already current"}` when nothing is outdated, and `{"error": "LLM provider required"}` when no LLM backend is configured (the graph is left untouched).
- New unit tests in `tests/tools/update_registered_graph/test_handler.py` covering missing graph, already‑current, LLM‑provider‑missing, construct_knowledge errors, successful update with object/relation/version‑patch operations, and evolve failures.

---

## [1.42.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **`check_component_versions` tool** – reads a registered graph (by name), finds every object with `type: "Component"` and a `version` field, fetches the corresponding `_version.py` from GitHub raw, and compares them using proper numeric version comparison. Returns `up_to_date`, `outdated`, `ahead`, `unknown_repo`, or `fetch_failed` per component. Reuses `_safe_request` for SSRF/DNS‑rebinding protection. Foundation for Memory Agent v2 (autonomous graph updates).
- New unit tests in `tests/tools/check_component_versions/test_handler.py` (26 tests) covering parameter validation, missing graph/session, version comparison helpers, network failures, unsafe URLs, and mixed‑status scenarios.

---

## [1.41.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **Plugin framework** (`src/cks_mcp/plugin.py`) – a new `CksPlugin` abstract base class and a `PluginRegistry` for managing optional, dynamically‑loaded functionality. Plugins declare their dependencies via `is_available()`, initialise themselves through `setup(runtime, config)`, and cleanly shut down with `teardown(handle)`.
- **`FastEmbedPlugin`** (`src/cks_mcp/plugins/fastembed_plugin.py`) – extracts the existing fastembed/HuggingFace embedding initialisation from `server.py` into a proper plugin. Automatically selected when the `fastembed` package is installed.
- **`GossipPlugin`** (`src/cks_mcp/plugins/gossip_plugin.py`) – extracts the existing gossip transport initialisation from `server.py` into a proper plugin. Requires `aiohttp` (`pip install cks-mcp[gossip]`) and is enabled with `CKS_GOSSIP_ENABLED=true`.
- **`list_plugins` MCP tool** – returns every registered plugin together with its description and whether it is currently available (`is_available()`).
- `server.py` now uses `PluginRegistry` instead of manually wiring the embedding and gossip subsystems.
- New tests in `tests/test_plugin.py`, `tests/plugins/`, and `tests/tools/list_plugins/`.
- Tool count increased from 45 to 46 (`test_server.py` updated).

---

## [1.40.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **Backup & migration tools (ADR-012)** – three new MCP tools for exporting, importing, and migrating data between storage backends:
  - `export_storage` – saves a complete dump of all sessions, versions, graphs, embeddings, and outbox tasks to a JSON file. Returns the file path and a summary.
  - `import_storage` – restores data from a previously created dump into the current backend (with `clear` or `merge` modes).
  - `migrate_storage` – transfers data from the current backend to a new one (SQLite or Postgres), creating a new file/database without replacing the active `runtime.storage`.
- All three tools are mechanical (no LLM). Registered in `registry.py` under the Export & Observability group.
- Tool count increased from 42 to 45 (`test_server.py` updated).
- New tests in `tests/tools/export_storage/`, `tests/tools/import_storage/`, `tests/tools/migrate_storage/`.

---

## [1.39.0] - 2026-08-05

### Added
- **`resolve_contradiction` tool** – resolves `contradiction_detected` tasks escalated by `ContradictionSweeper` (cks‑runtime v1.40.0). Two modes:
  * *Read‑only* (no `contradiction_ids`) – returns every currently‑live contradiction in the session, each with a stable `id` and its participating `relation_ids`.
  * *Resolve* (`contradiction_ids` + `commit: true`) – removes the alphabetically‑first conflicting relation for each contradiction via `evolve_knowledge`. Fully mechanical, no LLM call.
- **`contradiction_detected` support in `critic_agent.py`** – the Critic Agent now polls for `contradiction_detected` tasks (escalated by `ContradictionSweeper`) alongside the other four task types. Resolution calls `resolve_contradiction(contradiction_ids=[location], commit=True)`. An already‑resolved contradiction is treated as a success, not a retryable failure.
- Tool count increased from 41 to 42. New tests in `tests/tools/resolve_contradiction/test_handler.py` and `tests/test_critic_agent.py` covering mutual‑exclusion and functional‑relation violations, dry‑run vs commit, unknown ids, and the Critic Agent's dispatch path.

### Changed
- `critic_agent.py` now manages five task types (gossip, inference, provenance, temporal, contradiction). Docstring and `run_once` test updated accordingly.

---

## [1.38.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- **Memory Agent v2: graph freshness + gallery.** Two new MCP tools building on the `graph_registry` (Memory Agent v1):
  - `check_graph_freshness(name)` – read-only check of whether a registered graph is still fresh, using the same TTL `GraphFreshnessSweeper` (`cks-runtime` 1.39.0) applies in the background. Returns `{"fresh": true}` or `{"fresh": false, "last_updated": ..., "ttl_days": ...}`; `{"found": false}` if the graph isn't registered.
  - `search_graphs(query, tag?, public_only?)` – free-text, case-insensitive search over registered graphs' `name`/`description`/`tags`, so a caller can discover a graph to resume with `get_graph` without already knowing its exact name.
- `register_graph` now accepts an optional `public: bool = false` parameter, opting a graph into the gallery (discoverable by other callers, not just by exact name).
- `list_graphs` now accepts an optional `public_only: bool = false` parameter to restrict results to public graphs.
- New unit tests in `tests/tools/check_graph_freshness/` and `tests/tools/search_graphs/`; `tests/tools/register_graph/` and `tests/tools/list_graphs/` updated for the new parameters.
- Tool count increased from 39 to 41 (`test_server.py` updated).

### Requires
- `cks-runtime >= 1.39.0` for the `graph_registry.public` column and `RuntimeConfig.graph_freshness_ttl_seconds`.

---

## [1.37.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- **Memory Agent v1: graph registry tools.** Three new MCP tools that let LLMs (and humans) save, find, and reuse Knowledge Graphs across conversations by registering them under memorable names:
  - `register_graph(name, session_id, description?, tags?)` – register or update a named reference to an existing session's graph.
  - `get_graph(name)` – look up a registered graph and return its `session_id` and metadata, or `{"found": false}`.
  - `list_graphs(tag?)` – list all registered graphs, most recently updated first, optionally filtered by tag substring.
- The tools write to the `graph_registry` table added in `cks-runtime` 1.38.0, which is automatically created on first use in SQLite and Postgres backends. `InMemoryStorage` supports them for testing.
- New unit tests in `tests/tools/register_graph/`, `tests/tools/get_graph/`, and `tests/tools/list_graphs/`.
- Tool count increased from 36 to 39 (`test_server.py` updated).

---

## [1.36.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- **`temporal_conflict` support in `critic_agent.py`** – the Critic Agent now polls for `temporal_conflict` tasks (escalated by `TemporalStalenessSweeper`, cks‑runtime ADR‑011) alongside `gossip_conflict`, `inference_conflict`, and `provenance_conflict`. Resolution uses a safe default policy — `resolve_temporal_conflict(action="bump", extend_by_days=30, commit=True)` — rather than guessing whether the fact should be archived.
- New tests for `resolve_provenance_conflict` and `resolve_temporal_conflict` in `tests/test_critic_agent.py`, covering missing payload keys, successful resolution, tool errors, and commit failures.
- `test_run_once_drains_all_queues` updated to verify that `run_once` processes all four task types (gossip, inference, provenance, temporal) before stopping.

### Changed
- Docstring and comments in `critic_agent.py` updated to reflect four task types instead of two/three.

---

## [1.35.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- **`resolve_temporal_conflict` tool** – resolves `temporal_conflict` tasks escalated by `TemporalStalenessSweeper` (cks‑runtime ADR‑011). Supports three actions on expired facts:
  * `bump` – extends `valid_until` by a given number of days, anchored at `max(current valid_until, now)`.
  * `archive` – marks the object as `archived` with a timestamp and clears `valid_until` (object and its relations stay in the graph).
  * `ignore` – acknowledges the conflict without any modification.
  All actions are mechanical (no LLM) and are applied via `evolve_knowledge` when `commit: true` is set.
- **`temporal_validity` extension alias** added to `EXTENSION_ALIASES` in `validate` handler so `evolve_knowledge(extensions=["temporal_validity"])` resolves correctly (constraint already existed in cks‑core ≥ 1.20.0).
- Tool count increased from 35 to 36. 14 new tests in `tests/tools/resolve_temporal_conflict/test_handler.py`.

### Changed
- `tests/test_critic_agent.py` – cleaned up unused variable in metrics test; no functional change.

---

## [1.34.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- **`refresh_verification` tool** – resolves `provenance_conflict` tasks escalated by `ProvenanceStalenessSweeper` (cks-runtime ADR-010). Re‑runs `verify_source` against the original URL and applies the new verification record via `evolve_knowledge` when `commit: true` is set. Fully mechanical – no LLM call, no `auto_resolve` parameter.
- **`provenance_conflict` support in `critic_agent.py`** – the Critic Agent now polls for `provenance_conflict` tasks alongside `gossip_conflict` and `inference_conflict`. Resolution calls `refresh_verification` with `commit=True`; a failing re‑verification is retried with backoff and dead‑lettered after exceeding `CKS_CRITIC_MAX_RETRIES`.
- Tool count increased from 34 to 35. New tests for `refresh_verification` handler and for the Critic Agent's provenance resolution path.

### Changed
- `tests/test_critic_agent.py` – updated mock dequeue functions to handle the new `provenance_conflict` task type in `run_once` and metrics tests.

---

## [1.33.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added
- **`resolve_gossip_conflict` tool** (ADR-006) — closes the asymmetry between inference and gossip conflict resolution by adding an LLM‑assisted arbitration path for structural merge conflicts. The tool has three modes:
  * *Interactive* — returns conflicting objects with their `target_diff`/`source_diff` and a resolution policy; the caller supplies a `resolutions` dict on the next call.
  * *Unattended* (`auto_resolve: true`) — the tool calls an LLM via the same provider dispatch as `construct_knowledge`/`arbitrate_inference_conflict` and proposes ready‑to‑use resolutions.
  * *Bypass* — the caller can always hand‑craft resolutions and call `merge_branch` directly.
- Registered in the middleware stack under `_wrap_open_session` (mirroring `merge_branch`), so both `target_session_id` and `source_session_id` are validated before the handler runs.
- 12 new unit tests in `tests/tools/resolve_gossip_conflict/test_handler.py` covering the three paths, provider dispatch (`auto`/`ollama`/`anthropic`), error handling, and already‑merged edge cases.
- Tool count increased from 33 to 34. Documentation updated in `README.md`, `docs/tools/index.md`, and `docs/tools/gossip-and-conflicts.md`.

### Changed
- ROADMAP.md — the "LLM‑assisted gossip conflict resolution" item is now marked complete (`[x]`).

---

## [1.32.2] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed
- **User‑Agent header added to all outbound HTTP requests.** `_safe_request` (used by `ingest_document`, `verify_source`, and the Enrichment Agent's `robots.txt` check) now sends `cks-mcp/1.0 (+https://github.com/PunctumActus/cks-mcp)` instead of the default `python-requests/x.y`. Several major sites — notably Wikimedia — 403 generic default user agents. Without this, every enrichment attempt against wikipedia.org (the first default adapter) failed regardless of candidate relevance.

---

## [1.32.1] - 2026-08-04

### Fixed
- **Enrichment Agent scoring: zero‑relevance candidates can now be vetoed.** The relevance component of `score_candidate` previously had a 0.3 floor, meaning a high‑authority domain (wikipedia.org, arxiv.org) could clear `CKS_ENRICHMENT_MIN_SCORE` even when it had nothing to do with the query. The floor is removed; relevance now scales from 0.0, so a candidate with no term overlap can genuinely be filtered out regardless of authority.
- **Enrichment Agent deduplication: already‑enriched URLs are skipped.** A repeat `enrichment_request` for the same object no longer re‑ingests the same source (which would fail with a duplicate identity), wasting retries and eventually dead‑lettering the task. `_already_enriched_urls` scans the session for existing `enriched_by` relations and filters candidates accordingly.
- New tests: zero‑overlap relevance regression tests for arXiv and Wikipedia, dedup behaviour when one candidate is already enriched but another is new, and `_already_enriched_urls` ignoring other relation types/objects.

---

## [1.32.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added — Critic Agent Hardening
- **Lease heartbeat for long-running resolutions** – `critic_agent` now renews its outbox lease (via the new `touch_outbox_task` in cks‑runtime 1.35.0) while a resolver runs, preventing slow `auto_resolve` LLM calls from being reclaimed by another worker. If the lease is lost, the task is abandoned without completing/failing/dead‑lettering to avoid racing with the new claimant. Configured via `CKS_CRITIC_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL` (default 60s).
- **Circuit breaker on the LLM provider** – `LLMCircuitBreaker` opens after consecutive LLM‑attributable arbitration failures (`CKS_CRITIC_LLM_BREAKER_THRESHOLD`, default 3). While open, `auto_resolve` calls are skipped entirely for a cooldown period (`CKS_CRITIC_LLM_BREAKER_COOLDOWN`, default 60s), preventing one queued task per retry from burning LLM quota during an outage. Structural errors (e.g. `session_not_found`) never count toward the breaker. The mechanical `stale_premise_ids` path is unaffected.
- **Critic‑specific metrics** – `get_critic_metrics()` exposes processed/completed/retried/dead‑lettered counters per task type, `lease_lost`, and LLM breaker state. Wired into the existing `get_metrics` MCP tool as `critic_agent_metrics`. Process‑local (the Critic Agent runs as a separate OS process), so cross‑process observability requires future work.
- **Bugfix – mixed‑diagnostic `inference_conflict` tasks** – A payload containing both `CKS-EXT-INFERENCE-CONFIDENCE-CONFLICT` and `CKS-EXT-STALE-PREMISE` diagnostics now resolves each via a separate `arbitrate_inference_conflict` call, instead of sending both parameter sets in one call (which the tool rejects). A payload with only stale‑premise findings is now genuinely repaired, not silently marked complete.

### Added — Enrichment Agent (external RAG / graph auto‑growth)
- **`cks‑enrichment‑agent` console script** – a new unattended agent (separate OS process, same architecture as `cks‑critic‑agent`) that polls the outbox for `enrichment_request` tasks, searches external sources, and links relevant findings back into the graph.
- **`request_enrichment` MCP tool** – enqueues an enrichment request for a given object, optionally with a custom search query. Requires a persistent storage backend (SQLite/Postgres).
- **Enrichment library** (`src/cks_mcp/enrichment/`):
  - `filters.py` – deterministic low‑value URL filtering and operator‑configured domain/prefix allow/block policy.
  - `scoring.py` – candidate scoring by domain authority + query relevance.
  - `robots.py` – `robots.txt` compliance check for unattended fetches.
  - `adapters.py` – search adapters for Wikipedia (opensearch API) and arXiv (Atom API). Adapter failures are isolated per source.
- **Agent loop** (`src/cks_mcp/agent_loop.py`) – extracted from `critic_agent.py` so all unattended agents share the same lease‑renewal (`run_resolver_with_heartbeat`) and `Resolution` type.

### Changed
- Tool count increased from 32 to 33 (`request_enrichment`). Tests updated.
- `critic_agent.py` refactored to use the shared `agent_loop` module.
- `get_metrics` schema updated to describe the new `critic_agent_metrics` field.
- ROADMAP.md updated: Critic Agent hardening backlog items marked complete; Enrichment Agent design and future agents backlog added.

---

## [1.31.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **Critic Agent now correctly resolves `CKS-EXT-STALE-PREMISE` diagnostics** — previously a payload containing only stale-premise findings was marked complete without any repair. The agent now routes them to the mechanical `arbitrate_inference_conflict(stale_premise_ids=..., commit=True)` path, and mixed payloads (confidence conflicts + stale premises) are resolved via two independent calls instead of a single call that would be rejected as `invalid_parameter`.
- New regression tests: stale-premise-only resolution, step-level errors, mixed-diagnostic payloads handled via two separate `arbitrate_inference_conflict` calls, and partial failure in a mixed payload.

---

## [1.31.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- **`arbitrate_inference_conflict` now resolves `CKS-EXT-STALE-PREMISE`** via a new `stale_premise_ids` parameter. An active `InferenceStep` that still cites a since-superseded premise can now be repaired mechanically, without an LLM call, by repointing its `premises` to the current successor(s). The fix is applied through `evolve_knowledge` with `update_object` operations when `commit: true` is set.
- **`critic_agent.py` updated** to route `CKS-EXT-STALE-PREMISE` diagnostics to `stale_premise_ids` instead of dead-lettering them.
- New tests: `tests/tools/arbitrate_inference_conflict/test_handler.py` extended with 4 cases for `stale_premise_ids`.

---

## [1.30.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- **Critic Agent runtime loop** (`cks_mcp.agents.critic_agent.critic_agent`) — the autonomous, unattended process ROADMAP.md's "Next Up" section described as the last missing piece of the Critic-agent design. Runs as its own OS process with its own `Runtime` sharing storage with the main `cks-mcp` server (same SQLite file or Postgres DSN, via `CKS_MCP_DB_PATH`), and loops: `claim_conflict_task` → resolve → `complete_conflict_task`/`fail_conflict_task`/`dead_letter_conflict_task`, for both `gossip_conflict` and `inference_conflict` task types.
  - `gossip_conflict` resolution: `merge_branch(target_session_id=<task's session>, source_session_id=<payload's source_session_id>)`. A clean merge completes the task; a structural conflict (incompatible edits to the same object) is dead-lettered rather than guessed at.
  - `inference_conflict` resolution: a single batch `arbitrate_inference_conflict(auto_resolve=True, commit=True)` call covering every `CKS-EXT-INFERENCE-CONFIDENCE-CONFLICT` diagnostic in the task's payload. `CKS-EXT-STALE-PREMISE` findings have no arbitration primitive yet and are dead-lettered for human review.
  - A task is dead-lettered once its retry count would reach `CKS_CRITIC_MAX_RETRIES` (default 5) instead of being retried forever.
  - New console script: `cks-critic-agent` (entry point `cks_mcp.agents.critic_agent.critic_agent:main_sync`).
  - Env vars: `CKS_MCP_DB_PATH` (shared storage path, defaults to the same path `cks-mcp` itself uses), `CKS_CRITIC_POLL_INTERVAL` (default 5s), `CKS_CRITIC_MAX_RETRIES` (default 5).
  - New tests: `tests/test_critic_agent.py` (16 tests, including one end-to-end test against a real SQLite-backed `Runtime` and a real `merge_branch` call, not just mocks).

---

## [1.29.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- **Critic-agent tool suite for the persistent outbox** — `claim_conflict_task`, `complete_conflict_task`, `fail_conflict_task`, `dead_letter_conflict_task`, `list_dead_lettered_conflicts`. These give an external Critic agent running as a genuinely *separate OS process* (its own `Runtime`, its own empty in-process `ConflictInbox`) a way to see and resolve conflicts by sharing the same SQLite/Postgres backend as the main server, using `cks-runtime` 1.34.0's new `dequeue_next_outbox_task(task_type=...)`, `dead_letter_outbox_task`, and `list_dead_letter_tasks`. `claim_conflict_task` atomically claims one `gossip_conflict`/`inference_conflict` task at a time (so two Critic-agent processes polling concurrently never claim the same one); `fail_conflict_task` reschedules with the same exponential backoff `OutboxEmbeddingWorker` uses; `dead_letter_conflict_task` permanently retires a conflict the agent couldn't resolve with confidence, visible afterwards via `list_dead_lettered_conflicts`. All five report `supported: false` under storage backends that don't implement the outbox (e.g. the default `InMemoryStorage`) instead of erroring.
- **`gossip.py`/`observability.py` dual-write into the outbox** — `GossipConflictDetected` and `InferenceConflictDetected` are now also enqueued as outbox tasks (`task_type="gossip_conflict"`/`"inference_conflict"`) whenever `runtime.storage.supports_outbox` is true, in addition to the existing write into the in-process `ConflictInbox`. This is purely additive: `list_gossip_conflicts`/`list_inference_conflicts` are unchanged and remain the same-process read path; the outbox write is what makes conflicts visible to a genuinely separate Critic-agent process, which cannot see this process's `ConflictInbox` singleton no matter what. No-ops silently (as before) under `InMemoryStorage`.
- Tool count increased from 27 to 32. New tests: `tests/tools/{claim_conflict_task,complete_conflict_task,fail_conflict_task,dead_letter_conflict_task,list_dead_lettered_conflicts}/test_handler.py`, plus dual-write coverage in `test_gossip.py` and `test_observability.py`.

### Changed
- Minimum `cks-runtime` version raised to `1.34.0` for the `task_type`-filtered `dequeue_next_outbox_task`, `dead_letter_outbox_task`, and `list_tasks_by_type`.

---

## [1.28.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- **`list_inference_conflicts` tool** — drains (or peeks) the queue of reasoning conflicts found by `InferenceStalenessSweeper` (ADR-009) and published as `InferenceConflictDetected` events. Each record carries `session_id`, `version_id`, and `diagnostics` (code/severity/message/location). For `CKS-EXT-INFERENCE-CONFIDENCE-CONFLICT`, the `conclusion_id` can be extracted from the diagnostic message and passed to `arbitrate_inference_conflict` for resolution. Same peek/drain semantics as `list_gossip_conflicts`.
- **Parallel inference queue in `conflict_inbox.py`** — `ConflictInbox` now buffers `InferenceConflictDetected` events alongside gossip conflicts, with `record_inference()` / `list_inference()` methods and session-id filtering.
- **`InferenceConflictDetected` subscription in `observability.py`** — the event is always subscribed to (unlike gossip, which is opt-in), because `InferenceStalenessSweeper` is enabled by default in `cks-runtime` 1.33.0.
- New tests: `test_conflict_inbox.py` (inference queue), `test_observability.py` (subscription), and `tests/tools/list_inference_conflicts/test_handler.py`.
- Tool count increased from 26 to 27. Documentation updated: `README.md`, `docs/tools/index.md`, `docs/tools/gossip-and-conflicts.md`.

### Fixed
- `docs/tools/gossip-and-conflicts.md` — added missing `list_inference_conflicts` section and fixed broken cross-references to non-existent `reasoning.md` / `../adr/` files.
- `docs/tools/index.md` — now correctly lists 27 tools and includes `arbitrate_inference_conflict` and `list_inference_conflicts` in the Conflict Resolution group.

---

## [1.27.1] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **`evolve_knowledge` no longer silently drops non-blocking diagnostics on a successful commit.** `validation.is_valid` only means no `ERROR`-severity diagnostic was raised — a `WARNING`/`INFORMATION` (e.g. `CKS-EXT-INFERENCE-CONFIDENCE-CONFLICT`, `CKS-EXT-STALE-PREMISE`) could still be present and, once the commit succeeded, was discarded instead of being returned. A caller could commit an edit that lands on top of an unresolved belief conflict and never learn about it unless they separately called `validate_knowledge`. The response now includes a `diagnostics` field (same shape as the existing failure-path diagnostics) whenever validation produced any, on every successful commit, regardless of whether `extensions` was requested; the key is omitted entirely when there are none.

---

## [1.27.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- **Batch mode for `arbitrate_inference_conflict`** — pass `conclusion_ids` (a list of object ids) instead of `conclusion_id` to resolve several disputed conclusions in one call. With `auto_resolve: true`, every conclusion_id still needing a decision after `winners` is resolved in **exactly one combined LLM call** (not one per conflict). `commit: true` applies the whole batch as a single `evolve_knowledge` call / version. A bad or conflict-free entry only affects its own result, never the rest of the batch.
- **`winners` parameter** — batch counterpart to `winner_id`: an object mapping each `conclusion_id` to a pre-determined winner step id (e.g. `{"obj-1": "step-a", "obj-2": "step-c"}`). Conclusions covered by `winners` are not sent to the LLM.
- **`_extract_json_array` helper** — batch-specific JSON-array extraction from LLM output, matching `extract_json` semantics but anchored on `[`/`]` instead of `{`/`}`. Handles markdown fences, trailing commentary, and truncated output.
- **`_gather_active_steps` refactored** — shared by both the single-conclusion and batch paths, so they never disagree about how a conclusion's active steps are gathered.
- **`_dispatch_llm`** — single provider-dispatch function shared by `_call_llm` and `_call_llm_batch`, so the auto/ollama/anthropic branching is implemented once.
- 16 new unit tests in `tests/tools/arbitrate_inference_conflict/test_handler.py` covering batch parameter validation, mixed conflict/no-conflict entries, caller-supplied winners, combined LLM call behaviour, error isolation between entries, and batch commit.

---

## [1.26.0] - 2026-08-03

### Added
- **`source_session_id` in `list_gossip_conflicts` records** – each conflict record now carries the `session_id` of the local branch materialized from the remote replica's content that failed to merge (via cks-runtime's `register_foreign_branch`, ADR-008 status update). A Critic agent can pass `target_session_id=session_id, source_session_id=source_session_id` straight to `merge_branch` to get back the structured per-object diff, instead of having only a bare list of conflicting ids with no way to see what the remote side actually contained. Empty when branch registration itself failed (defensive fallback) or when a record predates this field.

### Changed
- Updated `conflict_inbox.py`, `list_gossip_conflicts` handler and schema, and tests to carry and document the new field.

---

## [1.25.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- **`arbitrate_inference_conflict` tool** – resolves an `InferenceConfidenceConflict` (ADR-001) when two or more active `InferenceStep`s conclude the same object but disagree. Three paths to a decision:
  * *Interactive* (no extra LLM call): returns `active_steps` (ranked by entrenchment) + the arbitration `policy`, so the calling LLM client can weigh them itself and call again with `winner_id` set to its choice.
  * *Unattended* (`auto_resolve: true`): the tool calls an LLM via the same provider dispatch as `construct_knowledge` (Ollama/Anthropic/auto) to apply the policy and returns the decision.
  * *Bypass*: the caller can always apply `evolve_knowledge`'s `resolve_inference_conflict` operation directly.
- **`commit` parameter** – when supplied alongside a decision (`winner_id` or `auto_resolve`), `arbitrate_inference_conflict` applies the winning step via `evolve_knowledge` (with `resolve_inference_conflict` + `inference_confidence_conflict`/`supersession_chain` extensions) and commits a new version, instead of just returning the decision.
- New `_wrap_open_session_fields` middleware factory in `registry.py` for tools that need field validation beyond `session_id`.
- 15 new unit tests in `tests/tools/arbitrate_inference_conflict/test_handler.py` covering the three decision paths, error cases (missing session, unknown winner, invalid LLM output), and commit integration.
- Tool count increased from 25 to 26 (`tools/list` test updated).

---

## [1.24.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- **`list_gossip_conflicts` tool** — drains (or, with `peek: true`, previews) the queue of gossip merge conflicts a running gossip peer (`CKS_GOSSIP_ENABLED=true`) escalated via `GossipConflictDetected` (cks-runtime ADR-008) but no one has resolved yet. Previously that event was only ever logged and lost — nothing consumed it, so an external Critic agent (a separate MCP client session responsible for deciding how to resolve conflicts) had no way to discover that a background gossip cycle had failed to merge automatically. Each record carries `session_id`, `source_replica_id`, the conflicting object ids, `detected_at`, and a `record_id`; resolving one is expected to follow up with `compare_versions`/`explain_diff` for the structured diff and commit the decision through the ordinary `merge_branch` call. See `docs/tools/gossip-and-conflicts.md`.
- **`conflict_inbox.py`** — new process-level `ConflictInbox` singleton (same shape as the existing `ToolTelemetry`: lazily-created `asyncio.Lock`, capped ring buffer) that `gossip.py`'s `setup_gossip` now subscribes to `GossipConflictDetected` on the Runtime `EventBus`. Scoped to `gossip.py` rather than `observability.py`'s always-on lifecycle logging, since the event only ever fires once gossip is running.
- 13 new unit tests: `tests/test_conflict_inbox.py` (record/list, drain-by-default vs. `peek`, `session_id` filtering, eviction cap) and `tests/tools/list_gossip_conflicts/test_handler.py`; plus one new wiring test in `tests/test_gossip.py` confirming `setup_gossip` actually connects `GossipConflictDetected` to the inbox, not just that the event class exists.

### Changed
- Minimum `cks-runtime` dependency raised to `>=1.31.2` (previously `>=1.31.1`), for `GossipConflictDetected.session_id` — without it, a drained conflict record couldn't say which session it belonged to, since the event previously carried only `source_replica_id` and the conflicting object ids.

---

## [1.23.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- **`evolve_knowledge` now accepts `resolve_inference_conflict`** as an evolution operation (`{"type": "resolve_inference_conflict", "conclusion_id": ..., "winner_id": ...}`), wired straight through from `cks.evolution.ResolveInferenceConflict` (cks-core 1.19.0). Lets an arbiter (human or agent) that has already decided which of several competing `InferenceStep`s should stand record that decision as a single atomic evolution instead of hand-rolling `update_object` patches per losing step.
- **`evolve_knowledge` now accepts `extensions`**, mirroring `validate_knowledge`'s parameter of the same name (same `resolve_extensions`/`EXTENSION_ALIASES` resolution). Previously `evolve_knowledge`'s commit-time `cks.validate()` call only ever checked `BUILTIN_CONSTRAINTS` — an evolution that wrote `InferenceStep` fields directly (via `update_object`, or the new `resolve_inference_conflict`) had no way to also ask for `supersession_chain`/`inference_confidence_conflict`/`confidence_bounds`/etc. to be checked before commit; the only way to catch a broken supersession chain was a separate `validate_knowledge` call against the already-committed version. The response now includes `extensions_applied` when extensions were requested, matching `validate_knowledge`.
- 5 new end-to-end unit tests in `tests/tools/evolve/test_handler.py` against a real `Runtime`: `resolve_inference_conflict` supersedes the loser and leaves the winner untouched, rejects a nonexistent winner, unknown extension name is rejected, an out-of-range confidence commits silently without `extensions`, and is rejected with `CKS-EXT-CONFIDENCE-BOUNDS` when `confidence_bounds` is requested.

### Changed
- Minimum `cks-core` dependency raised to `>=1.19.0` (previously `>=1.18.0`) for `ResolveInferenceConflict`.

---

## [1.22.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- **Inference chain visualisation in `visualize_graph`** — new `mode: "inference"`. Instead of the structural relationship graph, the tool builds a directed reasoning graph: it walks active `InferenceStep` chains, recursively expanding premises down to base facts. Supports:
  * auto-detection of target objects (the `conclusion` of any active `InferenceStep`) when `seed_ids` is omitted;
  * `cites_step` edges (dashed) — when one inference step references another as a premise;
  * superseded-step history (`superseded_steps`) when `include_superseded: true` is set;
  * cycle protection and a configurable node budget (`max_objects`);
  * a descriptive error when the attached Core does not implement the optional `explain_inference` capability.
- **`invalid_parameter` error helper** in `cks_mcp/errors.py` — unified handling of invalid parameter values.
- 5 new unit tests in `tests/tools/visualize_graph/test_handler.py`: invalid mode, basic inference chain, `cites_step` + superseded history, node budget, unsupported core.

---

## [1.21.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- **`explain_knowledge` accepts an optional `object_id` parameter** — when given, answers "why is this object currently believed?" instead of the general structure-wide explanation: routes to the new `ExplainInferenceOperation` (`cks-runtime` ≥ 1.31.0), which delegates to `cks.constraints.reasoning.explain_inference` (`cks-core` ≥ 1.18.0). Recursively walks every active `InferenceStep` chain concluding the object through its premises down to base facts, plus the belief's supersession history (`superseded_steps`). Works with both call shapes `explain_knowledge` already supported — `session_id` (read-only, via the non-committing executor, same as the existing `explain` path) and the `json_data` fallback (new session + committed transaction). An attached Core that doesn't implement the optional `explain_inference` capability, or an unknown `object_id`, now surfaces as a structured `internal_error` rather than a silently empty `explanation` — unlike the general explanation, there's no meaningful empty default for "why".
- Minimum dependency versions raised to `cks-runtime>=1.31.0` and `cks-core>=1.18.0` to match.

### Tests
- 5 new unit tests in `tests/tools/explain/test_handler.py` covering the `object_id` routing: session_id path success/failure, fallback path success/failure, and confirming the no-`object_id` case still uses the plain `ExplainOperation`.

---

## [1.20.3] - 2026-08-02

### Changed
- **`extract_json()` now always validates brace balance** — even when the raw string starts with `{`, the parser checks for balanced braces and trims trailing commentary. This catches truncated LLM output (e.g. cut by `max_tokens`) and trailing prose (e.g. "Hope this helps!") early, instead of failing later with a confusing parse error.
- **`_build_llm_structure` in `ingest_document` no longer accepts an unused `runtime` parameter.** Callers updated accordingly.

### Added
- **Direct unit tests for `llm_providers`** (`tests/test_llm_providers.py`) — covers `ollama_host`, `ollama_available`, `call_ollama`, `call_anthropic`, and `extract_json` with 20+ test cases, including error paths, truncated output, and trailing commentary. No existing test exercised these functions directly before.
- **Provider-dispatch tests for `ingest_document` LLM mode** (`tests/tools/ingest_document/test_llm_dispatch.py`) — covers explicit provider selection, auto-fallback, missing provider, and parameter forwarding, mirroring the dispatch coverage that already existed for `construct_knowledge`.

---

## [1.20.2] - 2026-08-02

### Fixed
- **Duplicate assignment in `html_extract.py`** – an `itemscope` handler contained a redundant `ctx = ...` line, causing a mypy `var-annotated` error. Removed the duplicate.
- **`test_html_extract.py` had no actual tests** – the file existed but contained only `print` statements, so pytest collected zero tests. Replaced with proper test functions covering JSON-LD, microdata, OpenGraph/Twitter meta, tables, lists, sections, edge cases (empty/malformed HTML). All assertions pass.
- **Documentation typo in `ai-assisted.md`** – the LLM error response example now shows the correct `"error": "internal_error"` shape instead of `"error": "llm_call_failed"`.

### Changed
- Updated docstring of `html_extract.py` to remove "Draft/scratch" label.

---

## [1.20.1] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- **`ingest_document` now extracts structured content** — uses a new single-pass HTML parser (`html_extract.py`) to capture JSON-LD, OpenGraph/meta/Twitter tags, schema.org microdata, tables, lists, and heading-delimited sections. These are turned into CKS objects (`Section`, `Table`, `List`, `Metadata`) linked to the `Document` via `has_section`, `has_table`, `has_list`, `has_metadata` relations.
- **`ingest_document` gains optional `use_llm` parameter** — when `true`, the extracted structured content is sent to an LLM (using the same pluggable provider auto-selection as `construct_knowledge`) to build a full knowledge graph instead of the deterministic baseline. Returns the richer structure directly.
- New shared HTML parser moved to `src/cks_mcp/tools/ingest_document/html_extract.py`; tests in `tests/tools/ingest_document/test_html_extract.py`.

### Changed
- `ingest_document` now returns up to 6 object types (`Document`, `Topic`, `Section`, `Table`, `List`, `Metadata`) plus their relations, giving LLMs a far more detailed starting point for further refinement.

---

## [1.20.0] - 2026-08-02

### Added
- **Optional gossip integration (`cks_mcp/gossip.py`)** – several running `cks-mcp` instances can now automatically sync their Sessions with each other via `cks-runtime`'s existing gossip stack (ADR-008). Off by default; opt in with `CKS_GOSSIP_ENABLED=true`. New `CKS_GOSSIP_*` environment variables control host/port/peers/interval/discovery — see [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md#gossip-syncing-sessions-across-multiple-cks-mcp-instances-optional) and [ADR-005](docs/adr/ADR-005%20Gossip%20Integration.md). Binds to `127.0.0.1` by default (not `GossipServer`'s own `0.0.0.0` default), and tracks Sessions automatically via `SessionCreated`/`SessionClosed` subscriptions rather than requiring manual bookkeeping.

### Fixed
- Depends on a `cks-runtime` fix (see that project's CHANGELOG) where `Runtime.create_session`/`create_branch`/`close_session` never actually published `SessionCreated`/`SessionClosed` on the EventBus — silently breaking both the structured lifecycle logging `observability.py` already claimed to provide and this release's gossip auto-tracking.

---

## [1.19.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- **`detect_contradictions` gains `inference_confidence_conflict`** – detects two or more active (non-`superseded_by`) `InferenceStep` objects that share a `conclusion` but disagree on `confidence` (see cks-core ADR-001, `cks-core>=1.16.0`). Reported at WARNING severity via the existing `contradictions` list, alongside the two existing ERROR-severity relation-pair checks.
- **`explain_diff` reports `added_inference_steps`** – added `InferenceStep` objects are now reshaped into a native reasoning summary (premises, conclusion, operator, confidence) in both `details.added_inference_steps` and the human-readable `summary`, instead of surfacing only as a generic added object.
- **`suggest_evolution` now advertises `record_inference`** – its operation-type template includes `record_inference`, so callers building a fresh operations list can find it without already knowing to look for it.

### Fixed
- **`validate_knowledge`/`detect_contradictions` couldn't resolve the ADR-001 reasoning extensions by name.** `EXTENSION_ALIASES` was never updated when cks-core shipped `inference_referential_integrity`, `confidence_bounds`, and `supersession_chain` (v1.15.2) -- every call using those names returned `unknown_extension` regardless of the structure's content. All three (plus the new `inference_confidence_conflict`) now resolve correctly.

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-core` dependency to `>=1.16.0` (adds `InferenceConfidenceConflictConstraint`; `>=1.15.2` is the actual floor `record_inference` needs, but `inference_confidence_conflict` requires 1.16.0).

---

## [1.18.1] - 2026-07-31

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.25.1` (Postgres fixes, single version source, CI with real PostgreSQL).
- Bumped `cks-core` dependency to `>=1.15.1` (RDF/XML hardening, determinism fix, public operator properties).

---

## [1.18.0] - 2026-07-31

### Added
- **Pluggable LLM providers for `construct_knowledge`** – supports local Ollama (no API key), Anthropic API, and auto-detection (`CKS_LLM_PROVIDER` env var).
- **`fastembed` as default embedding provider** – server now prefers local, token-free embeddings via `FastEmbedEmbeddingClient`. Falls back to HuggingFace if fastembed is unavailable.

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.25.0`.

---

## [1.17.0] - 2026-07-31

### Changed
- **Project restructuring** – every tool now lives in its own package under `src/cks_mcp/tools/<tool>/` with `handler.py` and `schema.py` (a plain Python dict, not JSON — several tools share long description text via `tools/_shared.py`, which a literal JSON file can't reference), matching the test layout. The registry module was renamed `tool_registry.py` → `registry.py` and now imports from these packages instead of defining everything inline.
- **Tests restructuring** – tests split into per-tool modules under `tests/tools/<tool>/` (one package per tool, `test_handler.py` inside), mirroring the source tree. Legacy integration tests remain at `tests/` level.
- **Comprehensive documentation** – added `docs/` with ADRs (Thin Translator, Provenance Signing, Middleware Stack, Extension Model), architecture docs (request lifecycle), protocol docs (prompts, resources), and per-category tool guides (lifecycle, branching, search-and-graph, verification, export-and-audit, ai-assisted).

---

## [1.16.1] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **`telemetry.py` mypy failure** – `dashboard()`'s `error_list` was annotated `list[dict[str, int]]` while its entries mix `str` ("type") and `int` ("count") values, tripping `mypy`'s `dict-item` check. Annotation corrected to `list[dict[str, str | int]]`.
- **`get_metrics` `top_errors` reported bogus `"str"` error type** – `log_tool_call` recorded `error_type=type(error_str).__name__` for structured `{"error": "<code>"}` tool results; since `error_str` is itself a `str`, this always evaluated to the literal `"str"` instead of the actual error code (e.g. `"session_not_found"`). Now records `error_str` directly. Exception-path recording (`type(exc).__name__` for raised exceptions) was already correct and is unchanged.

### Added
- `tests/test_observability.py` – regression coverage for `log_tool_call` error-type recording (structured error dict, raised exception, success case).

---

## [1.16.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added
- **Tool telemetry dashboard** – in-memory aggregator (`ToolTelemetry`) recording per-tool call counts, success rates, p50/p95/p99 latency percentiles, and top error types. Accessible via `get_metrics` as `tool_telemetry`.
- **Composable middleware layer** – `require_fields`, `require_session`, `require_open_session`, `catch_unhandled_errors`, and `with_middleware` composition helper. All 24 tools now have structured validation stacks.
- **`get_metrics`** response extended with `tool_telemetry` dashboard alongside existing `runtime_metrics`.

### Changed
- All tool handlers in `tool_registry.py` now use `_wrap`/`_wrap_session`/`_wrap_open_session` builders instead of raw `log_tool_call()` wrapping.
- `log_tool_call` now feeds data into `tool_telemetry` in addition to stderr logging.

---

## [1.15.0] - 2026-07-30

### Added
- **`construct_knowledge` tool** — builds a Knowledge Structure from free-form text using an LLM (Anthropic API).
- **`export_session` tool** — exports a full session bundle (structure + version history) for migration or archival.
- **`structure_filters` parameter for `query_subgraph`** — post-filter extracted objects by structure fields.
- **`rename_object` operation** — now supported in `evolve_knowledge`, `suggest_evolution`, and `compare_versions`.

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.23.1` (public operator properties, Postgres pgvector).
- Bumped `cks-core` dependency to `>=1.14.0` (`RenameObject` operator, public operator properties).

---

## [1.14.4] - 2026-07-30

### Fixed
- **BUG-04:** MCP parser now correctly handles multiple HTTP headers (e.g., `Content-Type`) between `Content-Length` and the request body, instead of failing to parse JSON.
- **BUG-02 (ingest_document):** replaced collision-prone `doc_id` truncation with a stable URL-hash-based identifier.
- **BUG-01 (embedding data loss, via cks-runtime):** SQLite `cks_object_embeddings` now uses composite primary key `(object_id, session_id)` to prevent cross-session overwrites.
- Removed unreachable dead code in `server.py` storage initialization.
- Ensured consistent use of `asyncio.to_thread` for OS-level file operations in `server.py` startup.

### Changed
- Added `filterwarnings` configuration in `pyproject.toml` to suppress spurious asyncio mark warnings on sync test methods.

---

## [1.14.3] - 2026-07-29

### Security
- **Closed provenance bypass in `serialize_knowledge` and `explain_knowledge`:** these tools now verify `VerificationRecord` signatures before persisting a session, preventing forged records from being committed. Regression tests added.
- **SSRF hardening in `ingest_document`:** replaced unsafe `requests.get` with shared `_safe_request` function (DNS pinning, manual redirect validation), matching the existing protection in `verify_source`.

### Fixed
- Removed unreachable dead code in `server.py` storage initialization.
- Ensured consistent use of `asyncio.to_thread` for OS-level file operations in `server.py` startup.

---

## [1.14.2] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- Console entry point (`cks-mcp` command) now correctly runs the async `main()` function via `asyncio.run()`, fixing a regression introduced in v1.14.0 that prevented the server from starting.

---

## [1.14.1] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed
- `search_semantic` now checks `supports_embedding_search` instead of `hasattr` for embedding capability detection, preventing spurious embedding client calls and misleading error messages.
- `server.py` now handles `asyncio.IncompleteReadError` gracefully, preventing crashes on truncated stdin input.

---

## [1.14.0] - 2026-07-29

### Added
- **Full async migration:** all tool handlers, `server.py` main loop, and `observability` now use `async`/`await`. The server leverages `asyncio` for non-blocking stdin reading and graceful shutdown.
- `Runtime` is now constructed via `await Runtime.create(...)`, enabling session restoration from persistent storage at startup.

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.22.1` (async runtime, Postgres backend, `search_embeddings` fix).
- `verify_source` and `ingest_document` HTTP calls are offloaded to threads via `asyncio.to_thread`.

### Upgrade Notes
- MCP clients (Claude Desktop) do not need any changes — the JSON-RPC protocol remains identical.
- Custom test suites calling tool handlers directly must `await` them and use `pytest-asyncio`.

---

## [1.13.2] - 2026-07-29

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.21.0` (Postgres storage backend, shared patch codec, async storage ABC).

---

## [1.13.1] - 2026-07-29

### Security
- **SSRF hardening:** `verify_source` now explicitly blocks additional non-public IP ranges (`100.64.0.0/10` — Tailscale/CGNAT shared address space, `192.0.0.0/24` — IETF protocol assignments) that Python's `ipaddress` module does not classify as private, closing a potential bypass into internal networks.

---

## [1.13.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- **`ingest_document` tool** — fetches a public URL, extracts title, description and keywords, and builds a Knowledge Structure with a Document object and Topic objects linked via `mentions` relations.

---

## [1.12.2] - 2026-07-28

### Changed
- `SERVER_VERSION` now derived dynamically from installed package metadata (`importlib.metadata.version`) instead of a hard-coded literal, matching `cks-runtime`'s pattern.
- Embedding client initialization failure is now logged to stderr with the underlying cause, instead of failing silently.
- `search_semantic` returns a clear message when no embedding client is configured, instead of leaking a raw `AttributeError`.
- Tool descriptions and module docstrings for `visualize_graph` and `prompts` no longer name a specific MCP client (Claude Desktop), keeping them neutral for future multi-model use.
- `ROADMAP.md` updated: removed hard-coded tool count, added `detect_contradictions` and `fork_sandbox` to completed milestones, removed `detect_contradictions` from planned v2.0 list.

---

## [1.12.1] - 2026-07-28

### Changed
- Added concrete examples of `MutualExclusionRule` and `FunctionalRelationRule` structures to `detect_contradictions` and `validate_knowledge` tool schemas, so LLMs no longer need to guess field names.
- Updated README with contradiction rule examples.

---

## [1.12.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- **`detect_contradictions` tool** — surfaces mutual exclusion and functional relation violations using the new contradiction constraints from cks-core.
- **`fork_sandbox` tool** — creates an isolated branch, optionally applies a hypothesis, and shows a diff from the fork point, all without affecting the parent session.

---

## [1.11.1] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- `validate_knowledge` now supports `mutual_exclusion` and `functional_relation` extensions for contradiction detection.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.20.2` and `cks-core` to `>=1.13.0`.

---

## [1.11.0] - 2026-07-28

### Added
- `suggest_evolution` now accepts an optional `operations` parameter: when
  provided, it dry-runs those candidate operations against the session
  (the same non-committing path `evolve_knowledge` uses internally) and
  returns `would_apply`/`diagnostics`/`preview_serialized` instead of the
  template/guidance response. Lets a caller check a concrete operations
  list before spending a real `evolve_knowledge` call — and a real
  version — on a guess. Fully backward compatible: omitting `operations`
  returns the same template response as before.

---

## [1.10.6] - 2026-07-28

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.20.1` (production stable status, `cks-core>=1.12.1` compatibility).
- Bumped `cks-core` dependency to `>=1.12.1` (fix for truncated `schema.py`).
- All three ecosystem packages now aligned on stable releases.

---

## [1.10.5] - 2026-07-28

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.20.0` (VersionVector and fast-path merge, ADR-007 Part 2). `merge_branch` and `merge_knowledge` automatically benefit from no-op and fast-forward detection.

---

## [1.10.4] - 2026-07-28

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.19.0` (indexed and vectorized embeddings, full mypy compliance, selective strict mode).

---

## [1.10.2] - 2026-07-27

### Changed
- Added `ruff` linting and `mypy` type checking to CI pipeline.
- Moved demo GIF to external hosting (GitHub Releases), reducing repository clone size by 6.7 MB.

---

## [1.10.1] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- `search_semantic` now supports an optional `min_score` parameter to filter results by minimum cosine similarity threshold. Results below the threshold are excluded, and an empty result set triggers a clear "nothing relevant found" message.

---

## [1.10.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- **`export_knowledge` tool** — export a session's Knowledge Structure to JSON-LD, Turtle, or RDF/XML, leveraging cks-core's built-in RDF/JSON-LD adapters.
- This is the 19th tool in the cks-mcp suite.

### Fixed
- `suggest_evolution` description in README and tool schema now accurately reflects its current behaviour.
- Updated MCP protocol version from `2024-11-05` to `2025-11-25`.
- Removed dead reference to non-existent `llm_client/cks_llm_client.py` from README.

---

## [1.9.3] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed
- `suggest_evolution` description in README and tool schema now accurately reflects its current behaviour (state inspection + guidance), removing promises of non-existent AI-generated operations and dry-run validation.
- Updated MCP protocol version from `2024-11-05` to `2025-11-25`.
- Removed dead reference to non-existent `llm_client/cks_llm_client.py` from README.

---

## [1.9.2] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed
- `visualize_graph` now returns `total_found_nodes`, `returned_nodes`, and `is_truncated` metadata, matching the contract of other subgraph tools.
- `max_objects` is now enforced consistently in both branches (with and without `seed_ids`), using `query_subgraph` with compact mode for all cases.
- Replaced `hasattr` duck-typing with `isinstance` for relation detection, matching the rest of the codebase.

---

## [1.9.1] - 2026-07-27

### Fixed
- `visualize_graph` now generates valid Mermaid syntax for all node IDs, including those with special characters.
- `explain_diff` now correctly distinguishes modified objects from add/remove pairs, and reports cascade-relinked relations as "relinked" rather than falsely claiming they were deleted and re-added.
- `suggest_evolution` now uses `isinstance(obj, CanonicalRelation)` instead of fragile `hasattr` duck-typing.

### Changed
- Extracted shared `field_level_diff` helper into new `cks_mcp.diffing` module, used by both merge tools and `explain_diff`.
- Extracted `TOOLS` registry into new `cks_mcp.tool_registry` module, reducing `server.py` from 929 to 322 lines.
- Added 6 functional end-to-end tests for the three new tools.

---

## [1.9.0] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- **`visualize_graph`** tool — exports a subgraph in Mermaid format for native rendering in Claude Desktop.
- **`explain_diff`** tool — produces a natural-language explanation of changes between two versions, complementing `compare_versions`.
- **`suggest_evolution`** tool — accepts a textual description of a desired change and returns a proposed list of valid evolution operators with a dry-run validation, without committing.
- 3 new tests covering the new tools' parameter validation.

### Changed
- `validate_knowledge` now supports `type_hierarchy` and `relation_type` extensions.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` to `>=1.18.2` and `cks-core` to `>=1.12.0`.

---

## [1.8.2] - 2026-07-27

### Added
- `validate_knowledge` now supports `type_hierarchy` and `relation_type` extensions, enabling ontology-based type checking and relation validation.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` to `>=1.18.2` and `cks-core` to `>=1.12.0`.

---

## [1.8.1] - 2026-07-27

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` to `>=1.18.1` (proper rollback with state restoration, DispatchRequest state mutation) and `cks-core` to `>=1.11.4` (UpdateObject export, iterative DFS, compose batching, CLI fixes, frozen metadata).

---

## [1.8.0] - 2026-07-27

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `revert_version` and `list_versions` now return the same structured `{"error": "<code>", "message": "<text>"}` shape as every other tool, instead of ad-hoc human sentences.
- `search_semantic` no longer silently swallows exceptions raised during vector search. The `not_found` response's `message` now includes the underlying error when one occurred.

### Added
- New `internal_error()` helper in `cks_mcp.errors`.
- New tests: `tests/test_revert.py` (9 tests) and `tests/test_search_semantic.py` (12 tests), including real end-to-end vector-search tests against a `SQLiteStorage`-backed `Runtime`.
- `search_semantic` now rejects an empty query immediately.
- `search_semantic` now includes a `scores` field in successful responses.

---

## [1.7.14] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- `search_semantic` now rejects an empty or whitespace-only `query` immediately with a clear `empty_query` error, instead of proceeding to (pointlessly) embed and vector-search on it.
- `search_semantic` now includes a `scores` field in successful responses when seeds were found via vector search — a dict mapping each matched seed `object_id` to its similarity score, to help debug strong vs. weak matches. Omitted when `seed_ids` were supplied explicitly, since there's no similarity score to report for those.

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.17.7` (`search_embeddings` now returns `(object_id, similarity_score)` pairs instead of bare object IDs; `search_semantic` has been updated to consume the new return type).

---

## [1.7.13] - 2026-07-26

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.17.5` (fixes `OutboxEmbeddingWorker` JSON payload parsing, enabling embedding generation for semantic search).

---

## [1.7.12] - 2026-07-26

### Added
- `server.py` now loads environment variables from `~/.cks-mcp/.env` at startup, ensuring `HF_TOKEN` (and any future configuration) persists across restarts and is always available to the embedding client.
- Removed old `src/cks_mcp/.env` and `src/cks_mcp/.env_example` in favour of the stable `~/.cks-mcp/` directory.

---

## [1.7.11] - 2026-07-26

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` to `>=1.17.4` (embedding dimension mismatch safety, proper `embedding_client` wiring) and `cks-core` to `>=1.11.2` (merge resolutions validation fix).

---

## [1.7.10] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed
- `search_semantic` now uses `runtime.embedding_client` (the same client instance used for indexing) instead of falling back to `StubEmbeddingClient`, restoring real semantic search functionality.

---

## [1.7.9] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed
- **Thread-safe DNS rebinding protection:** `verify_source`'s `pin_dns` context manager now uses reference-counted activation to prevent a race condition where a concurrent request could disable the DNS pinning for another in-flight request.
- **`Runtime` now properly stores and exposes `embedding_client`:** `search_semantic` was silently falling back to `StubEmbeddingClient` for query encoding, returning irrelevant results. Now uses the same client configured for indexing.
- **Embedding dimension mismatch detection:** `search_embeddings` now safely skips stored embeddings whose dimension differs from the query, instead of silently computing garbage similarity scores.
- **`KnowledgeStructure.merge()` contract fix:** a `resolutions` entry for an id that both branches touched but converged on the same value is now correctly rejected with `ValueError`, as documented.
- **Stable data directory:** provenance secret and SQLite database are now stored under `~/.cks-mcp` (overridable via `CKS_MCP_DATA_DIR`), so server restarts from different working directories no longer lose previously signed verifications or create empty databases.

---

## [1.7.8] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed
- **Critical provenance bypass:** `verify_structure_provenance` now identifies `verified_by` relations structurally (via `structure.relations()`), not by the caller-chosen `identity.type` string. Previously, a forged `VerificationRecord` linked by a relation with any `identity.type` other than the literal string `"Relation"` was invisible to the signature check and could be committed as a valid version.
- Added 2 regression tests confirming forged records are rejected and genuine records are accepted regardless of `identity.type`.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` to `>=1.17.3` and `cks-core` to `>=1.11.1`.

---

## [1.7.7] - 2026-07-26

### Fixed
- `evolve_knowledge` and `merge_branch` probe calls are now unmetered, so `get_metrics` no longer reports double the actual number of tool invocations.

### Added
- `merge_branch` conflict responses now include a `field_level_auto_merge_note` when the ADR-007 fast path was unavailable, explaining why the conflict wasn't auto-resolved.

---

## [1.7.6] - 2026-07-26

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.17.0` (adds field-level auto-merge for disjoint edits, ADR-007 Part 2). `merge_branch` and `merge_knowledge` automatically benefit from the new auto-resolution logic.

---

## [1.7.5] - 2026-07-26

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.16.0` (adds operation log for field-level change tracking, ADR-007 Part 1).

---

## [1.7.4] - 2026-07-25

### Changed
- Updated `search_semantic` tool description to reflect that vector search is live and `seed_ids` is optional.
- `merge_knowledge` now reports `dropped_relations` in its response when referential integrity causes relations to be excluded.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` to `>=1.15.0` and `cks-core` to `>=1.11.0`.

### Fixed
- `merge_knowledge` no longer silently drops relations without informing the caller.

---

## [1.7.3] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- 7 new tests for `merge_knowledge` covering conflicts, resolutions (branch_a, branch_b, custom object, malformed, partial).
- 5 new tests for `merge_branch` with resolutions.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.14.0`.

### Fixed
- `_parse_resolutions` now correctly handles raw JSON object definitions for custom resolutions in both merge tools.

---

## [1.7.2] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- `merge_branch` and `merge_knowledge` now accept raw JSON object definitions in the `resolutions` parameter, enabling custom synthesized conflict resolutions without pre-constructing KnowledgeObjects.
- 5 new tests covering all `resolutions` scenarios (branch_a, branch_b, custom object, partial, malformed).

### Changed
- Updated `merge_branch` conflict message to recommend using the `resolutions` parameter for a one-shot resolution.

---

## [1.7.1] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- `merge_branch` now accepts optional `resolutions` parameter, enabling partial merges with per-object conflict resolution strategies.
- Updated tool schema to document `resolutions` for `merge_branch`.

### Changed
- Improved default description for GPU in knowledge graph examples to enhance semantic search relevance.

---

## [1.7.0] - 2026-07-25

### Added
- `merge_knowledge` and `merge_branch` now accept an optional `resolutions` parameter for partial three-way merges, allowing callers to specify per-object conflict resolution strategies (`"branch_a"`, `"branch_b"`, `null`, or a custom object definition).
- Updated tool schema in `server.py` to document the `resolutions` parameter for both merge tools.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.13.0` (adds `resolutions` support in `CoreBridge.merge()` and `MergeOperation`).

### Changed
- `search_semantic` now correctly triggers vector search when `seed_ids` is omitted or empty, instead of requiring explicit IDs. The parameter is no longer listed as required.

---

## [1.6.19] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- `validate_knowledge` now retrieves the correct (most recent) failed operation result when recovering diagnostics from a `RuntimeError`, ensuring detailed error messages are returned instead of a generic "Validation failed".
- Bumped `cks-runtime` to `>=1.11.0` (automatic `parent_version_id` for branches, improved diagnostics recording).

---

## [1.6.18] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **Inconsistent error handling in `validate_knowledge`:** validation failures during commit (e.g., dangling references) now return structured diagnostics instead of a raw `RuntimeError` traceback.
- **`merge_knowledge` now returns structured diffs** for conflicts (`target_diff`/`source_diff`), matching `merge_branch`'s behavior instead of leaking Python `repr()` strings.
- **Updated `merge_branch` documentation** to reflect actual field names (`target_diff`/`source_diff` instead of `base_state`/`target_state`/`source_state`).

---

## [1.6.17] - 2026-07-24

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.10.3` (fixes OutboxEmbeddingWorker crash, restoring semantic embedding generation and enabling `search_semantic` without explicit `seed_ids`).

---

## [1.6.16] - 2026-07-24

### Changed
- `search_semantic` now normalizes query vectors, improving semantic search accuracy when combined with normalized embeddings from `cks-runtime>=1.10.2`.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.10.2`.

---

## [1.6.14] - 2026-07-24

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` to `>=1.10.0` — includes the new generalised Task Bus, enabling future background task types like conflict escalation.

---

## [1.6.13] - 2026-07-24

### Added
- `query_subgraph` now supports `compact_mode`. When set to `true`, the response contains arrays of `nodes` and `edges` instead of full canonical JSON, making the output significantly smaller and easier for LLMs to process.

---

## [1.6.12] - 2026-07-24

### Changed
- Merge conflict responses now include a human-readable `target_diff` and `source_diff` per conflict, instead of opaque `str()` dumps. This makes it easier for LLMs and users to understand what changed in each branch.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` to `>=1.9.5` (restores version history for persistent sessions).

---

## [1.6.11] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **Provenance signing secret now persists across server restarts.** If `CKS_MCP_SECRET` is not set, the server generates a random secret on first launch and saves it to `data/.cks_provenance_secret`. Previously verified `VerificationRecord` objects remain valid after restart.

---

## [1.6.10] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- **`evolve_knowledge` now validates the evolved structure before committing.** If the evolution would produce an invalid structure (e.g., dangling references from a misused `remove_relation`), the commit is blocked with a clear error, preventing corrupted data from entering the session history.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` to `>=1.9.4` (fixes embedding worker for delta versions).

---

## [1.6.9] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- `search_semantic` now filters out `Relation` type objects from the vector search results, ensuring that only domain objects (Concepts, Documents, etc.) are returned as seeds.

---

## [1.6.8] - 2026-07-24

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` to `>=1.9.3` — embedding worker now excludes relation objects, so `search_semantic` no longer returns false positives like relation IDs.

---

## [1.6.7] - 2026-07-24

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` to `>=1.9.2` (updated HuggingFace API endpoint).

---

## [1.6.6] - 2026-07-24

### Fixed
- Global `socket.getaddrinfo` monkey-patch replaced with temporary thread-local override, restoring DNS resolution for non-verification HTTP requests (e.g., Hugging Face API).

---

## [1.6.5] - 2026-07-24

### Changed
- Switched to `HuggingFaceEmbeddingClient` for free, token-based semantic embeddings via Hugging Face Inference API. Requires `HF_TOKEN` environment variable.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.9.1`.

---

## [1.6.4] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- Server now initializes `OpenAIEmbeddingClient` at startup, enabling real semantic embeddings for `search_semantic`. Falls back gracefully if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is not set or `openai` package is missing.

---

## [1.6.3] - 2026-07-23

### Changed
- `search_semantic` now uses the runtime's configured `EmbeddingClient` for query vectorization, enabling real semantic search when a real client is configured.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.9.0`.

---

## [1.6.2] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- `search_semantic` now correctly triggers vector search when `seed_ids` is omitted or empty, instead of requiring explicit IDs. The parameter is no longer listed as required.

---

## [1.6.1] - 2026-07-23

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.8.2` (fixes session association for embeddings; `search_semantic` now works without explicit seed_ids).

---

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-23

### Changed
- `search_semantic` now uses vector embeddings for ANN search instead of requiring explicit `seed_ids`. Falls back gracefully if embeddings are unavailable.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.8.1`.

---

## [1.5.4] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- **Content-Length parsing:** body is now read as bytes and decoded, fixing request corruption with multi-byte UTF-8 characters.
- **Off-by-one errors in `resources.py`:** `read_resource` now correctly resolves session, version-list, and specific-version URIs.

### Added
- `get_metrics` tool is now registered and exposed to clients.

---

## [1.5.3] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- Registered `get_metrics` tool in `server.py` — it was implemented but not exposed to clients, so LLMs couldn't discover it.

---

## [1.5.2] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- `get_metrics` tool — returns runtime metrics (invocation counts and average execution times per operation type).
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.6.2`.

---

## [1.5.1] - 2026-07-23

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.6.1` (fixes a critical bug where `Dispatcher.dispatch()` was not instantiating operations correctly, causing crashes for any `DispatchRequest`-based transactions).

---

## [1.5.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- `search_semantic` tool — performs semantic search over a session's Knowledge Structure. Accepts a natural language query and seed IDs, then expands the neighbourhood using `query_subgraph`. This is the first step towards a full vector-index-powered RAG pipeline.

---

## [1.4.1] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- `evolve_knowledge` now returns an optional `cascade_removed_relations` field, listing relation IDs that were silently deleted because a referenced object was removed. This makes cascade side effects explicit and auditable.

---

## [1.4.0] - 2026-07-23

### Added
- **MCP Prompts:** the server now offers ready‑to‑use prompt templates (`create_knowledge_graph`, `verify_claim`, `explore_subgraph`, `branch_and_merge`) via `prompts/list` and `prompts/get`. Users can select a workflow from Claude Desktop's prompt menu and fill in parameters without knowing the tool names or JSON syntax.
- New module `prompts.py` implementing the prompt handlers.

---

## [1.3.5] - 2026-07-23

### Fixed
- **Session leak on provenance rejection:** `validate_knowledge` and `evolve_knowledge` (without `session_id`) no longer create and persist a session before checking provenance. A structure with a forged or missing `VerificationRecord` signature is fully rejected — no `session_id` is returned, and no session is registered in the runtime. Previously, the session was persisted immediately, making the forged content readable via `serialize_knowledge`, `explain_knowledge`, `query_subgraph`, and MCP Resources.
- **Severity-blind blocking:** `evolve_knowledge`, `merge_knowledge`, and `merge_branch` now block only on `error`-severity provenance diagnostics (forged/ambiguous signatures). `warning`-severity diagnostics (e.g. a genuinely-signed but as-yet-unlinked `VerificationRecord`) no longer prevent a legitimate commit, restoring the two-step workflow of adding a signed record and linking it in separate operations.
- **Truthiness bug in `merge_branch`:** `if probe.payload` replaced with `if probe.payload is not None` to avoid skipping provenance check on empty but valid merged structures.
- Updated regression tests to cover session leak, severity-aware blocking, and false-positive unlinked-record scenario (50/50 tests passing).

---

## [1.3.4] - 2026-07-23

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.6.0`. Sessions and versions now persist across server restarts, fully restoring the operational state when Claude Desktop reconnects or the server process is restarted.

### Fixed
- After a server restart, all previously created sessions are now immediately available via `get_session()`, `list_sessions`, and the MCP Resources surface. No data is lost.

---

## [1.3.3] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- **Remaining provenance bypass in `validate_knowledge`:** the provenance-signature gate added in 1.2.6 covered `evolve_knowledge` and `merge_knowledge`/`merge_branch`, but not `validate_knowledge` itself -- which is the tool that actually creates a session's first committed version. It previously committed unconditionally and only checked `VerificationRecord` signatures afterward to set the response's `valid` field, so a forged record still ended up as a real, persisted version regardless of `valid: false` -- visible to `serialize_knowledge`, `explain_knowledge`, `query_subgraph`, and the MCP Resources surface with no indication it had failed a check. `validate_knowledge` now verifies provenance before deciding whether to commit at all, mirroring the existing dry-run-then-commit pattern; a structure with a forged or missing signature is validated (all core-level diagnostics still returned) but never committed, and the response omits `version_id` entirely rather than returning one for a version that doesn't exist.
- 5 new regression tests covering the forged-signature, missing-signature, genuine-signature, re-validation-of-an-existing-session, and no-VerificationRecord-present cases.

---

## [1.3.2] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- **Demo GIF** showing a complete CKS workflow from a single sentence ("Use cks-mcp to create a knowledge graph about the water cycle…"), including validation and explanation, all within Claude Desktop.
- Simplified **Quick Start** section explaining that CKS is just a conversation — no programming, no command line.

### Changed
- Updated README with demo GIF, streamlined installation instructions, and a new `query_subgraph` usage example.

---

## [1.3.1] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- Added `"resources": {}` to the server's `initialize` capabilities, enabling clients to discover MCP Resources.

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- **MCP Resources:** the server now exposes active sessions, their version histories, and each version's Knowledge Structure as virtual resources (`cks://sessions/...`). LLMs can read them directly without calling tools, making the knowledge graph instantly browsable.
- New module `resources.py` implementing `resources/list` and `resources/read` handlers.

---

## [1.2.6] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- **Critical provenance bypass:** `evolve_knowledge` and `merge_branch`/`merge_knowledge` now verify `VerificationRecord` signatures before committing new state. Previously, a hand‑written record with a fake signature could be inserted via evolution or merging, circumventing the check that `validate_knowledge` applies. This restores the invariant that only genuinely verified sources can appear as `VerificationRecord` objects in any session history.
- Extracted `verify_structure_provenance` into `provenance.py` as a shared helper, used by all tools that modify knowledge state.

---

## [1.2.5] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- Server now automatically falls back to a writable temporary directory (or in‑memory storage) when the default `data/` directory is read‑only, such as in Claude Desktop's sandboxed environment. This prevents `OSError: [Errno 30] Read-only file system` crashes.

---

## [1.2.4] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- Server now explicitly creates the `data/` directory for SQLite storage on startup, preventing crashes when Claude Desktop launches the server in a clean environment.
- Improved error logging during server initialization.

---

## [1.2.3] - 2026-07-22

### Changed
- Enabled persistent SQLite storage by default (`cks_mcp.db`), using `cks-runtime>=1.5.1`. Sessions and versions now survive server restarts.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.5.1`.

---

## [1.2.2] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- Structured JSON logging for every tool invocation (written to stderr), recording tool name, session_id, duration_ms, and success/error.
- Subscription to Runtime lifecycle events (`SessionCreated`, `TransactionCommitted`, `VersionCreated`, `ValidationFailed`, etc.) — all events are logged as JSON lines, providing a full operational audit trail.

---

## [1.2.1] - 2026-07-22

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.4.1` and `cks-core` to `>=1.9.1` (includes query_subgraph ordering and relation-as-seed fixes).

---

## [1.2.0] - 2026-07-22

### Added
- `query_subgraph` tool – extracts a k‑hop neighbourhood from a session's Knowledge Structure as a self‑contained subgraph, with optional relation/object type filters and a token/object budget that ranks candidates by degree, type weight, and distance. Returns full truncation metadata (`total_found_nodes`, `returned_nodes`, `is_truncated`, `truncation_reason`, `suggested_next_seed`) so an LLM agent always knows whether the neighbourhood was truncated and can resume from the suggested next seed.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.4.0` and `cks-core` to `>=1.9.0`.

---

## [1.1.1] - 2026-07-22

### Fixed
- `explain_knowledge` with `session_id` no longer creates a new empty version in the session's history. Read-only explanations now bypass the transaction pipeline and use the executor directly, preventing version history pollution. (#bug 1)
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.3.2` and `cks-core` to `>=1.8.3`.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-07-21

### Added
- `create_branch` tool — fork a new session from an existing one, optionally from a specific historical version, for isolated experimentation without touching the parent session.
- `merge_branch` tool — session-aware three-way merge between a target session and a branch session. Unlike `merge_knowledge`, the merge base is resolved automatically from the branch's recorded fork point; on success the merged result is committed as a new version of the target session, on conflict a structured `conflicts` list (`object_id`, `base_state`, `target_state`, `source_state`) is returned instead, with guidance not to retry `merge_branch` unchanged but to resolve conflicts via `evolve_knowledge`.
- `close_session` tool — closes a session, intended for releasing a branch session once `merge_branch` has integrated it.
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.3.0` for `Runtime.create_branch`, `CoreBridge.merge`/`supports_merge`, and `MergeOperation`.

---

## [1.0.10] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- `merge_knowledge` now correctly returns detailed conflict information (object_id, base, branch_a, branch_b) when a `MergeConflictError` occurs, using duck-typing instead of fragile class name checks.

---

## [1.0.9] - 2026-07-21

### Fixed
- `merge_knowledge` tool now correctly handles `MergeConflictError` without relying on direct imports.

---

## [1.0.8] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` to `>=1.2.3` and `cks-core` to `>=1.8.2` for merge support.
- `merge_knowledge` tool – three-way merge of Knowledge Structures with conflict detection.

---

## [1.0.7] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- Bumped `cks-runtime` dependency to `>=1.2.2` for full compatibility with delta version storage and performance improvements from `cks-core` v1.8.0.

---

## [1.0.6] - 2026-07-21

### Changed
- `compare_versions` now uses `session.get_version_state()` to reconstruct base versions, compatible with `cks-runtime` v1.2.0's delta version storage.

---

## [1.0.5] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed
- Server no longer crashes with an unhandled `ValueError` when a client sends a malformed `Content-Length` header. The error is now caught and returned as a proper JSON-RPC parse error, keeping the server alive for subsequent requests.

---

## [1.0.4] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed
- `compare_versions` no longer crashes with "Object of type RemoveRelation is not JSON serializable" when the diff contains relation removals. The serialiser now correctly handles all four operator types.

---

## [1.0.3] - 2026-07-20

### Fixed
- `compare_versions` now correctly computes the diff from `base_version` to `current`, and returns explicit `direction`, `base_version_id`, `current_version_id`, and a semantic `summary` (counts of added/removed objects and relations). This makes the diff direction unambiguous for LLMs.
- `ValidateOperation` now correctly returns `FAILED` status when the structure is invalid, preventing invalid structures from being committed as versions.
- `TransactionManager._finish` now removes completed transactions from the registry, preventing memory leaks.
- `Dispatcher.dispatch` no longer writes to the non-existent `context.diagnostics`.
- `CoreBridge.validate` now passes `extra_constraints` even when empty (`is not None` check).

### Added
- Integration tests for `compare_versions` direction and `TransactionManager` cleanup (2 new tests, total 30 passed).

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-07-20

### Changed
- `compare_versions` now returns explicit `direction`, `base_version_id`, `current_version_id`, and a semantic `summary` (counts of added/removed objects and relations), making the diff direction unambiguous for LLMs.
- Updated tool description in `server.py` to document the new response format.

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-07-20

### Added
- `compare_versions` tool: computes the structural diff between the current state of a session and a specified target version, returning a compact list of changes.
- Session-aware `serialize_knowledge`, `explain_knowledge`, and `evolve_knowledge` — all tools now accept an optional `session_id` to operate on existing sessions.
- Stable provenance secret via `CKS_MCP_SECRET` env var.

### Changed
- `verify_source` now uses deterministic, IPv4-first IP selection with automatic fallback.
- `VerificationRecord` shape and provenance checks are now unconditional, regardless of the `verification_record` extension parameter.
- Improved error responses for LLM readability.

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- First stable release of the CKS MCP Server.
- Unconditional verification of `VerificationRecord` shape and provenance, regardless of whether the `verification_record` extension is explicitly requested.
- Deterministic, IPv4-first IP candidate selection in `verify_source` with automatic fallback to additional resolved addresses.
- Updated tests covering the new IP resolution contract and fallback behaviour (32 tests total).

---

## [0.7.8] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- `list_versions` now builds version history directly from the session instead of delegating to the OperationExecutor, fixing the persistent error that prevented LLMs from inspecting session history.

---

## [0.7.7] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- **Session-aware tools:** `validate_knowledge`, `serialize_knowledge`, `explain_knowledge`, and `evolve_knowledge` now accept an optional `session_id` parameter to operate on an existing session instead of creating a new one. This enables predictable, multi-step workflows within a single session.
- `revert_version` now returns the `serialized` canonical JSON of the reverted state, eliminating the need for a separate `serialize_knowledge` call to verify the result.
- **Production-ready provenance:** The signing secret can now be configured via the `CKS_MCP_SECRET` environment variable (supports raw strings, hex, and base64), making provenance verification stable across server restarts.
- Improved error handling in `list_versions`.

### Changed
- `evolve_knowledge` no longer requires `json_data` when `session_id` is provided, reducing unnecessary re-parsing of large structures.
- Provenance checks now distinguish between ambiguous, unlinked, and unverified records for clearer diagnostics.

---

## [0.7.6] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- `list_versions` now handles internal errors gracefully and returns an empty list when no versions exist, instead of failing silently.

---

## [0.7.5] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- `evolve_knowledge` now accepts an optional `session_id` parameter. When provided, the evolution is applied to the existing session, adding a new version to its history. This enables predictable version tracking within a single session.

---

## [0.7.4] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Improved tool descriptions for `validate_knowledge`, `evolve_knowledge`, `list_versions`, and `revert_version` to explicitly document the session and versioning workflow, helping LLMs discover the correct usage pattern without trial and error.

---

## [0.7.3] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- `list_versions` and `revert_version` now require an explicit `session_id` parameter, eliminating unpredictable behaviour when multiple sessions exist. Tools always return the `session_id` they operated on.

---

## [0.7.2] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- Response format now matches the incoming request: `Content-Length`-framed for clients that use headers, plain line-delimited for legacy clients. This restores full compatibility with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients.

---

## [0.7.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- Server now supports both `Content-Length`‑framed and plain line‑delimited modes, restoring compatibility with Claude Desktop and other MCP clients that do not use headers.

---

## [0.7.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- `list_versions` and `revert_version` tools, giving LLMs the ability to inspect the version history of a session and safely roll back to any previous state. Powered by `cks-runtime`'s new `ListVersionsOperation` and `RevertVersionOperation`.

---

## [0.6.3] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- **HTTPS/SNI fix in `verify_source`**: Replaced custom HTTPAdapter with thread-local `socket.getaddrinfo` override, preserving SNI and SSL certificate validation while still preventing DNS rebinding.
- **MCP protocol compliance**: Implemented `Content-Length` header-based message framing, fixing potential JSON parsing errors for large or formatted requests.
- **LLM-friendly errors**: Business errors are now returned as successful tool responses with `isError: true`, allowing LLMs to read and recover from errors instead of treating them as server crashes.

---

## [0.6.2] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- Provenance check is now unconditional for any `VerificationRecord`, closing a bypass where an LLM could skip validation by omitting the extension parameter.
- DNS rebinding SSRF vector closed by pinning HTTP connections to the specific IP address resolved during the safety check.

---

## [0.6.1] - 2026-07-19

### Fixed
- Restored standard MCP protocol version (`2024-11-05`) that was accidentally overwritten, which prevented Claude Desktop from connecting.

---

## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- Provenance signing for `VerificationRecord` – only records produced by `verify_source` pass the new `CKS-MCP-UNVERIFIED-PROVENANCE` check.
- SSRF protection in `verify_source` – URLs are validated against public-IP allowlist.
- Unique IDs (uuid4) for all objects created by `verify_source`.
- Tests for SSRF protection, unique IDs, and provenance signing (7 new tests, total 24 passed).

### Changed
- All tools now catch `cks.SerializationError` and return structured error messages instead of raw tracebacks.
- `invalid_json_error` now accepts a `details` parameter.

---

## [0.5.2] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Improved error responses in MCP server: structured error messages with types (`invalid_json`, `validation_failed`) now replace raw tracebacks, helping LLMs understand what went wrong and how to recover.
- Updated server version string to 0.5.2 and imported new error helpers from `cks_mcp.errors`.

---

## [0.5.1] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- `serialize_knowledge` and `explain_knowledge` tools now read operation results directly from the transaction's `results` field instead of calling `CoreBridge` a second time. This eliminates redundant semantic computations and keeps all operation payloads in one place.

---

## [0.5.0] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- New `verify_source` tool. It performs an actual HTTP request to check a source's availability and creates a `VerificationRecord` object. This ensures that verification records can only be produced by real checks, not fabricated by the model.

---

## [0.4.4] - 2026-07-19

### Added
- `verification_record` extension now available in `validate_knowledge`'s `extensions` parameter. This extension checks the integrity of `VerificationRecord` objects, ensuring they have exactly one `verified_by` relation, a valid timestamp, a recognized check method, and no qualitative judgment fields.
- Updated tool descriptions with an example of a correct `VerificationRecord`.

---

## [0.4.3] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Added a complete worked example of a correct `EmbeddingProjection` with its `represents` relation to the description of the `extensions` parameter in `validate_knowledge`. This further reduces trial-and-error by giving the model a template to follow.

---

## [0.4.2] - 2026-07-19

### Changed
- Improved tool descriptions: `json_data` now includes a full worked example of a CKS Knowledge Structure, and `operations` in `evolve_knowledge` includes per‑operator field requirements and an example. This dramatically reduces the number of trial‑and‑error round‑trips a cold LLM needs to construct valid requests (measured: from 3 to 0).

---

## [0.4.1] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- Restored and expanded subprocess integration tests (`test_integration.py`) covering real stdin/stdout transport, including the new `extensions` parameter (3 new tests, total 19 passed).

---

## [0.4.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- `validate_knowledge` now supports an optional `extensions` parameter (list of human-readable names like `"embedding_projection"`) to opt into additional validation rules for a single call.
- Structured error response for unknown extension names instead of a raw traceback.
- Integration tests for the extensions feature with real Runtime + CksCoreAdapter (5 new tests, total 17 passed).

### Changed
- Updated `validate_knowledge` tool description in MCP server schema to document the `extensions` parameter.

---

## [0.3.3] - 2026-07-18

### Removed
- Deleted obsolete `src/cks_mcp/tools.py` – an outdated copy of test utilities that survived four releases.

---

## [0.3.2] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- `validate_knowledge` now correctly returns `"valid": false` with structured diagnostics when a Knowledge Structure is invalid, instead of crashing or hardcoding `true`. It reads diagnostics from the session after the validation transaction (bugs #1, #2).
- Updated tests to cover both valid and invalid structure scenarios.

---

## [0.3.1] - 2026-07-18

### Fixed
- `evolve_knowledge` now uses `cks.evolution.parse_operations` to convert JSON operation descriptors into proper `StructuralOperator` objects, fixing the `AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'apply'` crash.
- Requires `cks-runtime>=0.4.4` and `cks-core>=1.2.1`.
- Added missing `EvolveOperation` import in `evolve_knowledge` tool.

### Changed
- Updated tests to use valid JSON operation descriptors for evolve.

---

## [0.3.0] - 2026-07-18

### Changed
- Tools now use the full `create_session` → `begin_transaction` → `commit_transaction` cycle from `cks-runtime`. Every call produces an immutable Version and collects Diagnostics.
- Requires `cks-runtime>=0.4.2` and `cks-core>=1.2.0`.
- Responses now include `version_id` and `session_id` for traceability.

### Fixed
- `test_server.py` now uses serializable mocks for session and version, eliminating `Object of type MagicMock is not JSON serializable` errors.

### Updated
- README reflects transactional tool behaviour and new response fields.

---

## [0.2.1] - 2026-07-18

### Changed
- Improved tool responses for better LLM readability.
  - `validate_knowledge` now returns `error_count`, `warning_count`, `information_count` and a human‑readable message.
  - `explain_knowledge` now returns `object_count`, `relation_count` and a summary.
  - `evolve_knowledge` returns `serialized` result and `operations_applied` count.
- Updated tests to verify new response fields (11 passing).

---

## [0.2.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added
- Working MCP server with four tools: `validate_knowledge`, `serialize_knowledge`, `explain_knowledge`, `evolve_knowledge`.
- LLM client (`llm_client/cks_llm_client.py`) supporting Groq, DeepSeek, and local llama_cpp models.
- `.env` support via `python-dotenv`.
- Unit tests for server and tools (9 passing).

### Changed
- Tools now use direct `CoreBridge` calls instead of sessions/transactions (avoids serialization issues).
- Server reads JSON-RPC requests line-by-line from stdin and writes responses to stdout.

### Fixed
- `cannot pickle 'mappingproxy' object` error resolved by using `CoreBridge` directly.
- Valid Knowledge Structure JSON examples added to tests.

---

## [0.1.1] - 2026-07-15

### Fixed

- CI/CD publish workflow trigger.

---

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-15
