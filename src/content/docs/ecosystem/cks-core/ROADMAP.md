# CKS Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the planned evolution of the Canonical Knowledge Structure (CKS) ecosystem.

The roadmap is intentionally incremental. Each release aims to preserve backward compatibility whenever possible while extending the canonical specifications and the reference implementation.

---

# Guiding Direction

The long-term objective of CKS is to provide a universal, representation-independent semantic foundation for knowledge that can be shared across:

* humans
* software systems
* databases
* programming languages
* knowledge graphs
* artificial intelligence

The reference implementation evolves together with the formal CKS specifications.

---

# Current Status (August 2026 — v1.21.1)

Verified against `CHANGELOG.md`:

- **MCP Server (`cks-mcp`):** implemented and actively maintained separately (currently v1.59.0, 64 tools) — **done**.
- **Merge engine:** three-way merge with conflict detection — **done**.
- **Belief revision / reasoning engine:** `InferenceStep`, conflict constraints, `explain_inference`, `resolve_inference_conflict` — **done**.
- **Temporal validity checking:** opt-in `temporal_validity` — **done**.
- **Ecosystem layering rule:** opt-in `layering_rule` — **done**.
- **Documentation publishing pipeline:** CI builds cks-studio demo and publishes to GitHub Pages — **done**.

# Version 1.1 — Production Readiness ✅ (completed)

* Fix `CanonicalRelation` to explicitly validate `participants` and `relation_type`.
* Change development status to `Production/Stable` in `pyproject.toml`.
* Formalize that canonical identity is determined by `id` only.
* Remove Python <3.9 fallback from `plugin.py`.
* Replace stderr print with structured logging in `plugin.py`.

---

# Version 1.2 — CLI Modularization ✅ (completed)

* Split `cli/__init__.py` into separate handlers (`cli/commands/`).
* Add schema validation layer for operation files.
* Improve user-facing error messages in CLI.
* Add `--strict` flag for plugin failures.

---

# Version 1.3 — Contract Strengthening ✅ (completed)

* Extract `_normalize_structure()` for explicit structural comparison.
* Document the contract "specification → validator → tests → CLI → plugins".
* Add `mypy` type-checking to CI.
* Write contract tests for the plugin system.
* Create reference plugin examples.

---

# Version 1.4 — AI/LLM Integration (MCP Server) ✅ (completed)

* Implement CKS MCP Server. *(shipped as the separate `cks-mcp` repository, now at v1.28.0)*
* Provide standard MCP tools: `construct_knowledge`, `validate_knowledge`, `query_relations`/`query_subgraph`, `compare_structures`/`compare_versions`, `evolve_knowledge`, and 20+ more.
* Publish the server as a separate package (`cks-mcp`).

Also delivered as part of this phase, beyond the original scope: the belief-revision/reasoning engine (`InferenceStep`, `inference_confidence_conflict`, `resolve_inference_conflict`, `explain_inference`) that underpins `cks-mcp`'s conflict-resolution tools.

---

# Version 1.5 — Semantic Tools (next up)

Planned work — verified **not yet started** (no matching implementation in `CHANGELOG.md` as of v1.21.1):

* Build reasoning tools on top of CKS (pathfinding across relations, concept similarity).
* Expose semantic tools via MCP and CLI.

---

# Version 1.6 — Advanced SDK & Developer Experience

Planned work:

- Develop CKS Studio — **done** (shipped as separate `cks-studio` repo, v0.6.25).
- Add more adapters (OWL, CSV, Markdown tables) — **not started**.
- Client libraries for TypeScript and Rust — **not started**.

---

# Version 1.7 — IDE Integration

Planned work:

* VS Code extension with syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and inline validation.

---

# Version 1.8 — Distributed Knowledge Spaces

Planned work:

* Enable linking and synchronizing multiple Knowledge Structures across different sources.

> Note: `cks-runtime`/`cks-mcp` have already shipped gossip-based replication between runtime nodes (ADR-008) — this item is about extending that to `cks-core`-level Knowledge Structure linking/synchronization specifically, which is distinct and still open.

---

# Version 1.9 — Versioning and Merging

Planned work:

* Implement Git-like versioning, branching, and merging for Knowledge Structures.

> Note: three-way merge (`KnowledgeStructure.merge()`) and branch/merge orchestration (`create_branch`/`merge_branch` in `cks-mcp`) already shipped. Remaining scope here, if any, should be re-scoped against what's already delivered before further planning.

---

# Version 2.0 — The Semantic Foundation

Planned goals:

* Fully distributed CKS ecosystem.
* Stable MCP and semantic tools.
* Multi-language SDKs.
* IDE support.
* Large-scale knowledge repositories.
* Integration with major AI platforms.

---

# Project Philosophy

CKS favors long-term stability over rapid feature growth.

New functionality is added only when it preserves the core principles of:

* Representation Independence
* Structural Equivalence
* Observational Purity
* Deterministic Behaviour
* Canonical Semantics

The roadmap may evolve as the specifications mature and the community grows.
